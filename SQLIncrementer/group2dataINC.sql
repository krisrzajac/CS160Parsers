(442, 'Missouri\'s Civil War','Discover how Missouri emerges as a flashpoint of larger national tensions during the Civil War; how it offers a microcosm of the divisions between the North and South; and how it powerfully illustrates the devastation that civil war brought upon bitterly divided border states.','This course explores the history of Missouri during the Civil War era. It begins with three controversies that resulted from slavery遯ｶ蜀ｱ expansion into the trans-Mississippi West遯ｶ譚ｯhe Missouri Compromise, 遯ｶ蟒挈eeding Kansas,遯ｶ�ｿｽ and the Dred Scott ruling遯ｶ陏､nd uses them to explain how Missouri often stood as a flashpoint of national politics. Time and again, Missouri stood near the middle of sectional disputes over the future of slavery and liberty.\nA fiercely contested border state, Missouri was caught between not only the North and South but also the East and West. Like its neighbor, Kentucky, it was a slaveholding state that remained within the Union. Federal troops established a tenuous hold upon the state by the second year of the Civil War, yet they struggled to contain the irregular warfare that consumed much of Missouri. To maintain order within this divided society, Union leaders imposed martial law, loyalty oaths, and other increasingly stringent tactics. In addition, the eventual embrace of emancipation by federal troops and Radical Unionists showed how 遯ｶ蠕Ｂrd war遯ｶ�ｿｽ came to the trans-Mississippi West years before it struck the Deep South.\nWracked by bitter internal divisions, Missouri also suffered the worst guerrilla violence of the entire Civil War. Much of the course will examine this singularly devastating experience. As Union forces proved unable to defeat or expel pro-Confederate guerrillas from the state, federal commanders shifted their focus toward the civilians -�ｾゑｿｽmany of them female -�ｾゑｿｽwho fed, clothed, and sheltered these irregular fighters. This shift culminated in the 1863 execution of Order Number 11, which forcibly ejected several thousand civilians from four Missouri counties.\nThe course concludes by assessing the Civil War遯ｶ蜀ｱ legacies for freed people of color, defeated Confederates, and other Missourians. Looking to Reconstruction and the end of the nineteenth century, it reveals how Missouri illustrated both the promise and the limits of postwar reconciliation. Figures like Jesse James captured national attention but reflected the deep tensions that continued to grip Missouri. A string of films, from 遯ｶ蠑脚ue Grit遯ｶ�ｿｽ to 遯ｶ蠑吃e Outlaw Josey Wales遯ｶ�ｿｽ and 遯ｶ蠖拱de with the Devil,遯ｶ�ｿｽ suggests that the continued fascination with Missouri遯ｶ蜀ｱ Civil War will persist into the twenty-first century.\nIntended Audience: Course includes graphic images that may be not suitable for your children Time to complete the course: Two to three hours per week Certificate or digital badge for completing the course: A certificate of completion will be granted by the instructor, institution or organization Format: Instructor Led Asynchronous (independent) activities: Yes Synchronous (class) activities: None Instructor feedback: None Peer feedback: None Group work: None Prerequisites: None Recommended Materials: None\n','http://www.canvas.net/browse/missourisu/courses/missouri-civil-war','','2015-10-19',0,'https://instructure-gallery.s3.amazonaws.com/production/products/5d68ec5e98253528c45e835bd58c468c754cf989-thumb.jpg?1438380056','Course','http://www.canvas.net/browse/missourisu/courses/missouri-civil-war',0,'English','no','Missouri State University','2015-11-20 00:00:00'),

What can the world do to limit the impact of climate change on health? What policies are needed?','Prof. Rainer Sauerborn Climate Change and Health IPPC authors & experts from 10 countries answer the following questions: Which diseases will increase? Which populations are vulnerable? What can the world do to limit the impact of climate change on health? What policies are needed? About this course Climate change is currently at the center of the world遯ｶ蜀ｱ attention, with delegations from more than 190 countries meeting in Paris for the COP21 to negotiate an agreement how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep global warming under 2�ｾゑｽｰC. There are not many world citizens who do not have their children遯ｶ蜀ｱ and their own health as a top priority. So why is health not more prominent topic in the debate on climate change and its impacts? We hear a lot about polar bears and smokestacks in the media, but very little on the many and the large health impacts of climate change. With this MOOC, we want to provide state-of-the art evidence of the link between climate change and the health of populations. Who is this course for? We address the general public from all parts of the world. Health professionals may have a special interest and are very welcome, so are teachers and journalists, who may use this MOOC to disseminate the evidence provided. People working in meteorology and climate sciences, too, may be interested in health impacts and are welcome. In this interface between health and climate, there are few experts. So every interested global citizen, whether expert or not, is welcome to chime in. What do I need to know? The course does not require any knowledge about the climate system and climate change. You do not have to be a health person to follow as we cover ground on the link between climate change and health that will be new even for medical doctors. Of course you should be reasonably comfortable with English, not the least to be able to participate in the many interactive platforms and exercises offered during this MOOC. What will I learn? Knowledge: You will become familiar with the nature of health impacts worldwide, and for your country in particular. Further you will get to know best practices from around the world in adaptation strategies and the promotion of health co-benefits. There will be discussion forums for disease- and target-group specific interest groups, e.g. a forum on child malnutrition from climate change or health effects on the elderly. Skills: You will analyse your country as a case study throughout the course and share this work with other course participants on our country-specific platforms. You will understand the limits and strengths of your own country遯ｶ蜀ｱ climate adaptation plan. Action: Hence you will be able to engage national and local policy makers to improve health protection from climate change in your country. Interviews with national policy-makers will be part of the course. Prize: For the three best participants, I will wave the course fees (travel costs will be at your own expense) to participate in my 3 ECTS credit, in-depth presence course at Heidelberg University 遯ｶ蟒嗟imate change and health: impacts and adaptations遯ｶ�ｿｽ, running from July 18-29, 2016.

Enrol today and apply your learnings to climate policy and negotiations, on both national or international levels.','Climate Change & Health for Policy-Makers This course teaches you why health is a central theme and motivator in climate policy. Enrol today and apply your learnings to climate policy and negotiations, on both national or international levels. About this course This MOOC was developed by four eminent scientists who together authored the health chapter in the recent 5th Assessment report of the IPCC. They offer you a short crash-course into the topic of climate change, tailored to senior policy-makers and negotiators of climate agreements, particularly as an input into the climate conference COP21 in Paris in December this year. This 1 week MOOC requires 3 hours of investment time and provides hard evidence for four key arguments as to why health is and should be central in climate policy. Two positive arguments: 1. Health is a positive motivator, a driving force for citizens and policy-makers to care about and act on climate change. 2. The huge health co-benefits must enter the risk-benefit calculations. However, two arguments pertain to the restrictions that our health and physiology impose on humans under climate change, particularly in a world that is +4�ｾゑｽｰC warmer: 1. There are health limits to adaptation. 2. Decreased work productivity in hot countries. Finally, we should consider health as an indicator, not only for sustainable development, but also for climate policy. Who should take this MOOC? Senior, experienced members of climate negotiation teams from all 195 member states of the UNFCC. The course is launched to allow policy-makers involved in the Climate Conference COP21 in Paris 2015 to take it as part of their brief. In addition, any policy maker at local, national, regional and global levels would benefit from the course, but in keeping with the philosophy of MOOCs, the course is open to any citizen interested in the topic. What do I need to know? Participants should be familiar with the essentials of the climate systems and the current debate on mitigation and adaptation policies, as well as proposals for fair financing of the shared but differentiated responsibilities of rich and poor countries, which are the agenda of the COP21 conference. What will I learn? (i) The participant will understand why health is not another sector but a key argument in developing climate policy and fair share of the burden and benefits of climate policies. (ii) The participant will learn the scientific evidence behind the four key climate policy arguments based on human health: 1. Health is a positive motivator, a driving force for citizens. 2. The huge health co-benefits must enter the risk-benefit calculations. 3. There are health limits to adaptation. 4. Decreased work productivity in hot countries. Course Structure The course is organised in 4 lectures, each developing the evidence for the 4 health arguments, which we propose are inherent in all negotiations on climate policy: 1. Health is a positive motivator, a driving force for citizens. 2. The huge health co-benefits must enter the risk-benefit calculations. 3. There are health limits to adaptation. 4. Decreased work productivity in hot countries. The four short lectures (8 minutes) are complementary and follow a common storyline. So it is desirable that the participants watch all of them. This would be an essential useful minimum of investment. We offer 7 optional quiz questions for each lecture in case the participant wishes to check on his or her comprehension of the factual information provided. Our discussion forums are key to our MOOC concept. This enables participants to engage in an exchange of views and information on any topic they wish related to the course topic. The course instructor and his assistant will actively participate in the forums. Weekly YouTube feedback video: The course instructor will personally answer questions that are of great common interest or are frequently asked during a weekly youtube video, put on line each Friday at 2pm CET. Personal email feedback: The instructor and our team will be available to respond to individual questions and comments directed at us through internal mail during the 3 months of the course will be online.','https://iversity.org/en/courses/climate-change-health-for-policy-makers','https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3jv75K7IY0?wmode=transparent&showinfo=0&autohide=1&fs=1&rel=0&enablejsapi=1','2015-11-20',1,'https://d1wshrh2fwv7ib.cloudfront.net/courses/6a8c3c16-8b28-4f82-8278-a850a930a71a/medium_70220042713420.jpg','Political Science','https://iversity.org/en/courses/climate-change-health-for-policy-makers',0,'English','no','','2015-11-20 00:00:00'),

English is the global language. Learn the most important vocabulary for communicating in private or professional contexts. About this course Course Summary The climate change and the shortage of the fossil resources are energy-related topics that lead to discussions about the energy supply of the future: On a local and on a global level, in professional and in private contexts. Following the catastrophe in Fukushima the awareness for the necessity of discussing increased. In Germany, the reaction resulted in the so-called 遯ｶ蟒｢nergiewende遯ｶ�ｿｽ 遯ｶ�ｿｽ the energy transition. While English 遯ｶ�ｿｽ as lingua franca 遯ｶ�ｿｽ cannot solve the problems of energy supply, it can at least aid finding the right words when talking about finding a solution. Within the wide field of energy, this MOOC focuses on the topics closely related to energy transition. However, it will not give a deep insight into the technical terminology e.g. of a power plant. Who can participate? This course is aimed at professionals and students with previous English knowledge, interested in refreshing their language skills and learning the most important vocabulary from the energy world, particularly the topics connected to the energy transition. The course is especially suitable for those who would like to push their international career in the energy sector and those who would like to brush up their language skills before joining the \"Energy English\" further education course at KIT: www.zml.kit.edu/energy-english. What do I need to know? Some prerequisite knowledge is required: English level at A2/B1 or above according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). No particular knowledge is required on the topic of Energy. What will I learn? The overall course objective is to acquire a sound basis in the necessary vocabulary for communicating about topics concerning the energy transition. The aim is for students to both understand and be able to use this vocabulary in context. The quantifiable goal is the acquisition of between 20-30 vocabulary words per week. You will be trained in the passive skills of listening and reading comprehension as well as the active skill of writing when discussing in the forum or completing exercises. After completion of this MOOC the participants shall be supplied with the solid basic vocabulary to follow and participate in discussions on the above mentioned topics in private as well as in professional contexts, to understand texts or videos on energy transition. These discussions could be in a business context e.g. negotiation with an international partner, or with a political background. Course Structure Chapter 1: Energy Transition 遯ｶ�ｿｽ Introduction What is the Energy Transition, and why do we need it? A look at the concept of moving away from fossil fuels and toward renewable and sustainable energy sources. Some big-picture ideas: public policy, implementation targets, energy security. Chapter 2: Generation How is power generated? An overview of our current situation (fossil fuel and nuclear powered thermal energy plants), a look at turbines and energy conversion, and a short introduction to the mature renewable technologies that are currently on the market (biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, hydro). Chapter 3: Transmission and Distribution How does power get from where it is generated, to where it is consumed? An examination of our current infrastructure (the power grid) and the importance and challenges of keeping the grid balanced. Introduction to the next generation of infrastructure: smart grid technology - what it is, and the fundamentals of how it works. Chapter 4: Storage How can we integrate renewables into the existing energy infrastructure? The current system is demand-oriented; renewables are inherently supply-driven. One key way to bridge this gap is by using energy storage. This is an overview of the most promising technologies currently available (pumped-storage hydro, batteries, compressed air, thermal energy storage, power-to-gas methane synthesis). Chapter 5: Efficiency and Usage The two pillars of the Energy Transition are sustainable energy and energy efficiency. Without efficiency, energy demand continues to grow unchecked and the Transition will fail. This unit focuses particularly on energy use/consumption in buildings, and the enormous role human behaviour plays in efficiency and the reduction of energy demand. Chapter 6: Future of Energy Research in sustainable energy and energy efficiency continues to advance - what are some potential untapped sources of energy? What are the effects the technologies of today will have on the future?

The second part of this MOOC covers the prevention and intervention strategies available at the international level. What will I learn? Our MOOC will help you answer the following questions: 1. What is bullying? How can I recognize it? 2. How do new information and communication technologies modify traditional bullying behavior? Is 遯ｶ�ｿｽvirtual遯ｶ�ｿｽ bullying less 遯ｶ閻鋲al遯ｶ�ｿｽ than face-to-face bullying? 3. What are the risk factors for (cyber)bullying? And its consequences for youth? 4. What role do the family, school and peers play? 5. How can bullying and cyberbullying be prevented? What can schools, parents, and the society do about them? What really works? Who is this course for?

About this course Course Summary Games have become the new normal. The gaming industry is already more powerful than any other form of entertainment like music or movies. An average young person will spend more than 10,000 hours gaming by the age of 21 - about the amount of time that it takes us to master any kind of skill and yet, there\'s a huge engagement crisis in many other areas. 70% of US full-time employees are not motivated by what they are doing, but World of Warcraft players can spend up to 17,000 hours online. In 2014, competitive eSports tournaments gathered more than $30 million in prizes and it keeps on increasing. Meanwhile, kids now spend way more time engaged to video games than they do with books, with an average attention span that is now less than 10 seconds and decreases every year... It seems like only games are truly understanding how human motivation really works. But how is that possible? Why are we that glued to games? Can we design those kind of gameful experiences in non-game contexts to make them more engaging? And the most important question: How to do it? What will you learn? In this course you\'ll learn the basics of Gamification with a highly practical approach. We\'ll focus on how to design gamified experiences in real life and students will be able to gain knowledge in areas such as: game design, psychology, management or education. Our main goal will be to understand and master the principles of Gamification to design experiences that make things more fun and engaging. Who should take this course? Do you want your team to perform better? Are you looking for ways to fully engage happy customers? Do you want to see kids learning while playing? Or are you just looking forward to seeing a better world? Gamification can be used in many areas and almost any task can be fun and engaging. This course could be great for many different interest groups, including: teachers, educators, managers, C-level executives, health and fitness professionals, psychologists or researchers. So... Whether you ever asked yourself one of these questions or you just want to know how to make things more fun and engaging, this course is for you! Do I need prior knowledge? This course goes from a basic level to an advanced one so all you need to bring in the class is a playful attitude! Anyway, having some prior knowledge is always great, so if you already want to start this epic adventure, here are 3 ways you can do so: If you are more the reading type of person: http://www.epicwinblog.net/2013/05/best-gamification-books-where-to-start.html If you遯ｶ蝗� rather watch some videos: http://www.epicwinblog.net/p/epic-win-videos.html And if you don\'t like those options, well, there遯ｶ蜀ｱ always a way.

Every week, a space within the forum will be opened for you to upload the task and peer to peer reviews. It is not mandatory to complete these assignments in order to achieve any of the course\'s certificates but it is truly recommendable if you want to learn how to create and design real life gamification.

About this course Course Summary Genius, talent and golden mediocrity are different dimensions of human existence. Our course shows how these three dimensions manifest themselves in life and how you can fulfill your genius, abilities, talents more fully and completely. The course is of an applied nature and is oriented to studies in the field of creative life intensification psychology, help with the experience of crises, human potential realization and care. It may be useful for professional psychologists, for specialists whose activity involves empathy, inspiration, understanding and creating of daily life, and for all who are interested in the topic. The course is made in the popular form of short videos relying on free network resources users. What will I learn? A phenomenological description of genius, talent and golden mediocrity as specific dimensions of human life, correction of errors and misapprehensions of common sense. We critically examine the manifestations of the studied \"dimensions\" (phenomena), in order that by putting off all \"the supposed\" we could find specific and inherent meaning. The phenomenological method is to understand and express in simple terms the fundamental structure of creative activity, to express everything that was, that is and that will be important in the psychology of creative life. What do I need to know? No prior knowledge of phenomenology of genius, talent and mediocrity is needed in order to attend the MOOC. General cultural knowledge, interest in creativity, phenomenology, and psychology is welcome. It is advisable to understand what benefits a person in general and a student of this course in particular to have an access for literary writings, for the environment (online in our case) to meet with people, for travels, for participation in the upbringing of children, etc. We assume that students will be quite tolerant to some uncertainty in the process of clarifying the meanings and fundamentals for the intensive creative life. Our target audience: students of psychology, social sciences, art; professional psychologists; specialists whose activity involves empathy, inspiration, understanding and creating of daily life; everyone who is interested in the topic.

The EU represents the world遯ｶ蜀ｱ largest trade power and aid donor, has a diplomatic service larger than that of most states, and has launched more than 20 civil-military operations. It has presented itself as a normative, global actor, and its emergence as a legal entity that is neither a state nor a classic international organization has both puzzled and fascinated legal scholars and political scientists alike. We represent a consortium consisting of the Global Governance Programme of the European University Institute in Florence, the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies and the Chair for European and International Economic Law at the University of Passau. We have joined forces guided by the vision of providing cutting-edge expertise on the many facets of this fast-evolving topic to the greatest number of students. What will I learn? At the end of the course you will 遯ｶ�ｽｦ be able to identify and understand the main challenges of the EU and its Member States in the world today, and how they affect us personally understand the means which the EU has at its disposal to tackle these challenges, and learn ways to critically evaluate its performance. understand and be able to apply the key legal principles and political realities governing EU external relations, its relationship with its Member States and citizens, and the outside world. situate the EU as an international actor into the main theoretical approaches to International Relations, and harness these approaches to analyse current topics in global politics. What do I have to know? Basic knowledge in one or more of the following subjects is highly recommended: The EU and its institutions / EU politics EU / International law International relations / politics, foreign policy.

About this course Course Summary This MOOC is an introduction in Critical Thinking, with an emphasis on using reason in our daily communication. Its main topics cover the structure and analysis of arguments, the study of inductive reasoning as basis for scientific knowledge and as key ingredient in how we understand reality. Next we will focus on fallacies (like loaded question or hasty generalization) and on guidelines for structuring a presentation, an argumentative essay or a debate. Furthermore, the course gives you an overview of cognitive biases (a fashionable topic nowadays), and on the use of emotional tools in persuasion. The teaching is accompanied by tons of documented experiments and fun examples, guided practice, quizzes, links to additional materials (like TED talks) and short homework. What do I learn? After taking this course you will have the tools to analyze the truth of all kinds of statements, from opinion articles to court verdicts and investment proposals. You will better understand the philosophical basis of human knowledge, also you will be more persuasive in domestic talks as well as in good structured presentations, debates or argumentative essays. Furthermore, a main goal of this course is that you will be able to recognize and refute the most common fallacies (reasoning errors), and understand irrational behavior. What do I need to know? No prior knowledge is needed for this course, participants should only come equipped with natural curiosity and a respect for the truth.

About this course Architecture 101 To learn more about architecture 101, we kindly invite you to read about it in the first part of the course description, here. Eventually, also read the description of part 2 here. Architecture 101 (part 3: from space to architecture) In part 1 of our course, we explore the state of nothingness and start to understand the idea of 遯ｶ蠕詫ace遯ｶ�ｿｽ. In part 2 we learn to transform a place into a space. Now, we are ready for part 3: to transform a space into architecture. What does it mean to transform a space into architecture? 遯ｶ蟒｣rchitecture is the thoughtful making of space.遯ｶ�ｿｽ Louis Kahn In part 2, we learn that space is composed of mind and matter. Now, in order for us to benefit from this matter, we need to put it in order. And this is exactly what architecture is all about. Architecture is about giving a very specific kind of meaning and symbolic value to a series of different things. In this part of the course, we will plan, design and construct a system in which to organize and render coherent important matter (that matters to us). A matter of structure and proportions. By doing so, we will give a new sense to place and space. Are you ready? Our 6-month online journey will be celebrated at Abadir in Sicily, where we will set up our final exhibition. Course Structure Week 1: materials Week 2: colors Week 3: sounds Week 4: moving images Week 5: animations Week 6: the video Week 7: about the exam Week 8: break / exhibition / graduation party at Abadir, in Sicily Week extra: Architecture 101 Summer Camp at Abadir, in Sicily (where we will build for real). If you are still alive by then, this 遯ｶ蠕鷲ysical遯ｶ�ｿｽ 5-day workshop is a course in itself and it will soon be officially announced. What will I learn? To see architecture like architects do. To explore the ways in which space becomes architecture. To learn that form follows fiction. We will also learn a significative amount of extremely interesting (and totally useless) things. All of the above refers to the conceptual part of our course. Then, since we love having our students making practical things, you will also learn lots of technical things using a number of interesting applications. At the end, what do I make? A video (with a given set of constraints) in which you will show your built 1 to 1 architecture. If one thousand people finish this part 3, we will have a fabulous collection of 1000 videos representing 1000 architectural concepts. Prior knowledge This is the 3rd part of a tripartite course called Architecture 101. To have followed the first 2 parts (1 + 2) is highly recommended, however not required. Then, in terms of other kinds of prior knowledge, nothing in particular is required. However, in terms of technical equipment, this course will be easier to follow for those with access to a smartphone or tablet. You don遯ｶ蜀ｲ need a smartphone or tablet. But, as we wrote, we imagined a class with thousands of people lost in their phones, from all around the world. In commuters, we trust! Workload Between 3 and 7 hours a week. From Monday to Friday, for a total of 6 weeks, you will receive an email with a 15 second-video to watch (to get you in the mood), and a pdf with some instructions for completing an assignment and a series of references (to go deeper in the subject at hand).

Design Thinking - a multi-stage innovation process that focuses on human needs. Understand theoretical foundations and practical techniques, whether your are a manager, entrepreneur, designer or student. About this course Welcome to the Macromedia University Design Thinking MOOC. The Macromedia University MOOC Design Thinking is about understanding and implementing the methodology of Design Thinking. You will learn how Design Thinking uses creative, human centered techniques as a strategic approach to stimulate innovation. At MHMK, Macromedia University of Applied Sciences, we believe that human needs and experience should drive innovation 遯ｶ�ｿｽ not technology. Being a school whose graduates will engage in designing the digital landscape surrounding us, we like to share our conviction of a good, decent and ethical way of creating tomorrows products and services. Sign up now! What to Expect The Macromedia MOOC Design Thinking links theoretical frames with practice. You will look into fundamentals like historical and theoretical aspects of design, design models and design systems. You will gain deeper insights into the Design Thinking methodology and the human-centered design approach. You will learn how to apply teamwork and communications skills, and you will hear about creativity methods and visualization tools in the context of strategic design. And last but not least, the Macromedia MOOC Design Thinking will teach you how to evaluate ideas and concepts and why an innovation attitude and intercultural communication competence is crucial for a successful implementation. Week by week we invite you to meet academics, professionals and students, who are using Design Thinking in the creative industries as well as in management in order to solve problems of great complexity. Each week is divided into three or four lectures/chapters. Each lecture is divided in several lessons/units, which are usually not longer than 5 mInutes. The lessons are made of video material, slides, additional reading material and tasks. Expect to view approx. 80 minutes of lectures per week which sums up to altogether 5 hours per week incl. self-study time.

To us, managing creativity means drawing on various findings and multidiscliplinary methods, yet guiding them through standardized and verifiable management procedures. Besides Design and Art history, the background of our MOOC team therefore ranges from business, psychology and human resource to transmedia, visualization, narration, and journalism, for instance. We will thus be able to discuss Design Thinking from various perspectives. Learning Outcomes Our MOOC will help you answer the following questions:遯ｶ�ｽｨ 1. What is Design Thinking? Which benefits may I expect when implementing it as a management strategy? 遯ｶ�ｽｨ2. How can innovation be systematically triggered ?遯ｶ�ｽｨ How can I implement Design Thinking into my own projects? 3. Talking about the potential of Design Thinking 遯ｶ�ｿｽ what kind of best practices are there ? 遯ｶ�ｽｨ4. What kind of team do I need to in order to initialize a Design Thinking process? Prior Knowledge No prior knowledge of Design Thinking is needed in order to attend the MOOC. 遯ｶ�ｽｨInterest in creative techniques, innovation and management is welcome.遯ｶ�ｽｨ- You don\'t know what human centered design, strategic design or participatory innovation culture is? - Great, you\'ll learn it here.遯ｶ�ｽｨ- You are a business development specialist? - Great, we hope to inspire you.

With prototypes you can communicate, test and iterate on your design. In this course you遯ｶ蜀､l learn the different methods of prototyping by sketching, building and testing. About this course Course Summary Prototyping is a skill every designer should master, since it\'s the most effective, fast and often cheapest way to make your ideas tangible and communicate them. In this course you\'ll learn to think by using your hands to make your design a better experience for your end users by sketching, experimenting, making and testing. In this six week course, you will be working on a prototype for a concept you遯ｶ蜀､l develop in the first weeks involving a mobile device. You will be exploring different types of prototyping, from paper prototypes to a digital prototype and eventually even a physical prototype. In a world where we have to deal with new technologies on a daily basis, the prototyping process will help you understand the user and the way he or she interacts with these new and existing technologies. Understanding and executing this process will make your design stronger and more valuable to the end user. What will I learn? By the end of the course you know how to incorporate prototyping interaction in your design process. This will not only make your design process more effective, it will also help you to get new insights about the user and the way he or she interacts with your product or service. What do I need to know? Prior knowledge is not required, but some practical experience in UX design, interaction design and design principles is recommended. Be aware of the fact that you can earn two types of certificates. Chapter 1 to 4 will earn you a certificate covering prototyping for user experience for mobile devices. The second version (chapter 1 to 6) includes physical prototyping. For this you need to purchase a physical prototyping tool (e.g. a Makey Makey, an Arduino or a Touchboard) prior to, or at the start of week 4 of the course. Course Structure 1. Start it: defining the design challenge & generating an idea In this chapter we will explain what design challenge you will be working on for the next six weeks. Topics: introduction to prototyping interaction, research, idea generation and experience prototyping Workshop: storyboarding 2. Sketch it: visualizing & paper prototyping Visualize your idea by sketching and paper prototyping. Topics: sketching interfaces and paper prototyping Workshop: paper prototyping 3. Fake it: digital prototyping & tools Use digital prototyping tools to make your prototype interactive. Topics: digital prototyping, tools, transitions & gestures, connectivity Workshop: digital tools 4. Test it: testing with digital prototypes Testing you digital prototype and iterate on your design. Topics: user centered design, usability testing Workshop: testing 5. Make it: physical prototyping Make a physical object or a maquette, anything that will help you translate your idea from your screen to the physical world.

(505, 'Architecture 101 - Part II','From place to space: To turn a place into a space. To see spaces like architects do.','Stefano Mirti and Anne-Sophie Gauvin Architecture 101 - Part II From place to space: To turn a place into a space. To see spaces like architects do. About this course Architecture 101 To learn more about architecture 101, we kindly invite you to read about it in the first part of the course description, here. Being this part 2 (from place to space), in order to understand the whole picture, it is better to start from part 1. Architecture 101 (part 2: from place to space) In part 1 of our course, we explore the state of nothingness and start moving towards the idea of 遯ｶ蠕詫ace遯ｶ�ｿｽ. In part 2, we deal with the concept of 遯ｶ蠕詫ace遯ｶ�ｿｽ and our conceptual journey goes on towards 遯ｶ蠕ｭpace遯ｶ�ｿｽ. In short: part 1: from nothingness to place part 2: from place to space part 3: from space to architecture Places to stay, to move, to eat, to cook, to love. Place to live. Place to die. Places for our bodies, places on our bodies. Places to clean and remember. We went all over the place... Different places for doing so many different things. Different places and different positions, all weaven to different states of mind. Of course, in this 6-month journey called 遯ｶ蟒｣rchitecture 101遯ｶ�ｿｽ, we expect the final output to be about making architecture. And it will be (part 3). But as we said before: we cannot make architecture without understanding what space is, and we cannot sense any kind of space before knowing about 遯ｶ蠕詫ace遯ｶ�ｿｽ, and we cannot imagine any kind of place without getting into a mental and physical state of pure nothingness. So now, how do we go from to place to space? As John Cage told us in the first week of part 1, \"There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot.\" 遯ｶ蟒ｬn a small room one does not say what one would in a large room.遯ｶ�ｿｽ (Louis Kahn) What more could we add? In this part of the course, we will understand what kind of matter surrounds us and how this matters to us. What matters? This is what we will need to find out. Then, we will try to define the boundaries of this matter at hand. Adding a new dimension to the whole thing, we will put ourselves into context. A physical and a mental context. All of this, using a 遯ｶ蠕Ｂnds-on遯ｶ�ｿｽ system (you will learn by doing). Course Structure Week 1: taking measurements Week 2: proportions Week 3: technical drawing Week 4: papercut models Week 5: the history of place / the history of space Week 6: in a world of webzines Week 7: what is an 遯ｶ蠖ｳxam遯ｶ�ｿｽ? Week 8: what is a 遯ｶ蠖决eak遯ｶ�ｿｽ? Learning Objectives We will see spaces like architects do. We will explore the ways in which place becomes space. We will learn to measure and project ideas into a 3 dimensional way. We will also learn a significative amount of extremely interesting (and totally useless) things. All of the above refers to the conceptual part of our course. Then, since we love having our students making practical things, you will also learn lots of technical things using a number of interesting applications. What will I make? A scale model in a box (a box with a given proportion, size, appearance) in which you will represent a specific 遯ｶ蠕ｭpace遯ｶ�ｿｽ. If one thousand people finish this part 3, we will have a fabulous collection of 1000 boxes. A cool exhibition is on its way. Makes sense, don遯ｶ蜀ｲ you think? Prior knowledge This is the 2nd part of a tripartite course called Architecture 101. To have followed the first part is highly recommended, however not required. Then, in terms of other kinds of prior knowledge, nothing in particular is required. However, in terms of technical equipment, this course will be easier to follow for those with access to a smartphone or tablet. You don遯ｶ蜀ｲ need a smartphone or tablet. But, as we wrote, we imagined a class with thousands of people lost in their phones, from all around the world. In commuters, we trust! Workload Between 3 and 7 hours a week. From Monday to Friday, for a total of 6 weeks, you will receive an email with a 15 second-video to watch (to get you in the mood), and a pdf with some instructions for completing an assignment and a series of references (to go deeper in the subject at hand). Then, you will get to work on your assignment. Once you complete your assignment, you will upload it to the iversity platform and share it on your preferred social media account(s).

Khalifa, Dipl. Geogr. Wolfram Lange, Prof. Dr. Lars Ribbe, and Prof. Dr. Harald Sander Disasters and Ecosystems: Resilience in a Changing Climate Disasters kill people, destroy infrastructure, damage ecosystems and undermine development. Climate change is expected to aggravate existing disaster risks. Ecosystem-based approaches for disaster risk reduction can be a strategy with multiple benefits. About this course offered by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Cologne University of Applied Science Course Summary This MOOC enhances knowledge and skills for tackling complex issues such as resilience and transformation, sustainable development, ecosystem management, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and how they can be operationalized. It will benefit disaster managers and practitioners, climate change adaptation professionals, development planners, project implementers and policy makers. The course will be delivered through a series of lectures and case studies, quizzes, peer-reviewed exercises, along with additional study materials provided to the students. Lectures will be available through videos as well as online documents and will be geared for students who may not have access to high speed internet so they can follow the course. Students will be provided the opportunity to enhance their critical thinking through real life and fictitious problem solving exercises. Each week will feature an international expert who will be available to respond to questions and interact with students. What will I learn? After completion of the course, the participant will be able to: Define basic concepts of disasters, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and resilience. Recognize key linkages between ecosystems, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Recognize the linkages and overlaps between ecosystem based disaster risk reduction and ecosystem based adaptation. Identify various ecosystem based tools in reducing disaster risk and climate change adaptation. Identify key international agreements, organizations and initiatives related to disaster risk reduction, and climate change adaptation. Apply concepts and tools of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) and ecosystem based adaptation (EbA). Evaluate costs and benefits of different type of measures for reducing disaster risks. Design your own ecosystem-based project for increasing resilience and reducing climate risks. What do I need to know? There are no prerequisites, just some willingness to learn about this innovative topic! It is however true that it will help if you have heard about disasters and climate change before starting. Course Structure The course is structured in two parts: The leadership track, which is tailored for busy professionals or students curious about the topic. The leadership track will run three weeks. The expert track is for professionals and students who seek more in-depth learning and skill development in applying ecosystem-based tools for disaster risk reduction and adaptation. The expert track will run 12 weeks with 3 weeks for the final assignment, peer review process and course wrap-up. Each unit has several quizzes, a concise background document for further reading, a discussion forum, supplementary videos with interviews with international experts and short documentary videos from around the world.

In total, we estimate that a total of 40-50 hours is needed to complete the MOOC (taking both the Leadership and Expert Tracks), which will also depend on your background and English fluency. The MOOC is roughly equivalent to a 1 遯ｶ蜉ｪeek in-class training course. This estimate is based on completing the video lectures, guest video lectures, reading materials and exercises. Do I have to be online at specific times? No. While new modules will be released sequentially on specific dates, you need not come online simultaneously. The lectures are not webcast real-time and you can choose the time you wish to watch them. However, there will be some deadlines for assignments and peer-to-peer reviews. Will there be exams involved? The Leadership track has quizzes so you can self-check your knowledge level as you go. This is, however, not a precondition for progressing to the next module. And you may, however, choose to revisit a module if you feel you did do not perform satisfactorily in a module. The Expert track has two short peer-reviewed assignments and one final peer-reviewed exercise where you will be designing your own project! The peer reviewed exercises will provide an environment for interaction between course participants. You are welcome to use any other communication tool to facilitate group assignments. What are the interactive features in this MOOC? Iversity has a community discussion forum that will be followed by course instructors and a roster of international 遯ｶ蟒｢xperts of the week遯ｶ�ｿｽ. The Iversity platform offers all participants the chance to give feedback on the MOOC itself but also to start discussions on any topic related to the MOOC.

But the major problem is not what we eat, the major problem is how much we eat.','Gerhard P�ｾ�ｽｼschel Molecular Basis of Nutrition-Related Diseases Nutrition and health is a matter of concern to many people. Most often, we ask what kind of food is healthy or what we should avoid. But the major problem is not what we eat, the major problem is how much we eat. About this course Course Summary Over the past decades world hunger has been joined by a second nutrition problem: chronic over nutrition and lack of exercise in industrialized and developing countries. The ensuing overweight and obesity pose a severe health problem. Picking the most relevant examples, this short course will analyze the biochemical basis of the development of diseases associated with the so called metabolic syndrome. Among others, the steps towards the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis will be discussed. This course is divided into 4 chapters. In each chapter one particular nutrition-related disease will be discussed on three levels. What will I learn? Level 1: Basic understanding of how poor lifestyle impacts on the regulation of physiological processes. Level 2: Understanding of the major biochemical principles underlying selected examples of nutrition-related diseases. Level 3: Sound understanding, which experimental evidence supports the current views on the development of certain nutrition-related diseases. What do I need to know? Level 1: Basic knowledge in biology Level 2: Basic knowledge of biochemical principles Level 3: Advanced knowledge in biochemistry Course Structure Chapter 1: Insulin Resistance. You will learn, how overweight and obesity cause insulin resistance in the different organs. Chapter 2: Type 2 Diabetes. You will learn about the current ideas, how reversible insulin resistance irreversibly proceeds to type 2 diabetes and how the late complications of type 2 diabetes develop. Chapter 3: Dyslipidemias. You will learn, how lipids are carried in our blood and distributed throughout the body, what controls their levels and how this control is impaired in disease. Chapter 4: Atherosclerosis. You will learn, how different risk factors, among others type 2 diabetes, dislipidemia and hypertension, contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and its consequences like stroke and heart attack.

The course will answer such questions, stressing the multi-level dimensions of the work for human rights.','Prof. Paolo De Stefani, Dr. Claudia Pividori, Andrea Cofelice, Pietro de Perini, and Federica Napolitano Human Rights: Global & Local Protection When and why have human rights become effectively central? The course will answer such questions, stressing the multi-level dimensions of the work for human rights. About this course Course Summary Human rights are a complex issue. Their protection and promotion involve a number of actors: from international organisations to local communities, from governments to civil society. Human rights affect all aspects of our life, as individuals (as women, men, children, refugees, workers遯ｶ�ｽｦ) and as members of a community. This MOOC provides students with critical knowledge concerning the norms, institutions and procedures tasked to promote and protect human rights. Students will acquire the knowledge needed to actively join the global debate on fundamental rights and to avail themselves of the existing legal and institutional tools set up for their implementation. The MOOC introduces to the human rights legal framework in a multi-disciplinary and multi-level perspective, helping students to approach real-life scenarios with competence and cultural and ethical awareness. What do I learn? Students are expected to acquire a sound knowledge of the international system of human rights protection, and of the opportunities for human rights promotion and protection that are practically available at the national and local levels. The skills acquired can be preparatory for further specialisation on this subject. Finally, students will be able to apply the acquired knowledge and skills to real scenarios, including in relation to their everyday life. What do I need to know? The MOOC is mainly addressed to people from all over the world who have a background in political science, international relations and/or international law. The course, however, includes a general introductory chapter explaining the main issues, concepts and scenarios at stake. For this reason the MOOC is also open to people actively engaged on the ground that do not have a specific academic or educational background. Course Structure Chapter 1 - The basics The Chapter aims to introduce the course and starts addressing (and providing some preliminary answers) some basic questions: What are human rights? Who is involved in their protection? Why are human rights a global priority? How can effectively be protected? Chapter 2 - The UN and human rights The focus is on the evolution of the UN commitment in human rights protection based on three pillars: positivisation, monitoring and mainstreaming. Chapter 3 - The UN human rights machinery The analysis deals with the UN mechanisms for the protection of human rights at the global level. Special attention will be given to the role of the Human Rights Council and the Universal Periodic Review. Chapter 4 - The European system for the promotion and protection of human rights The Chapter starts looking into the promotion and protection of human rights at regional (continental or sub-continental) levels. In particular, the European system will be presented highlighting the respective roles of the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the OSCE and their capacity to interplay and possibly complement each other. Chapter 5 - Regional systems for the promotion and protection of human rights in Africa, Asia and the Americas The other regional systems investigated in this chapter are those operating in the framework of regional organisations in the Americas (the Organisation of American States), in Africa (the African Union), in the Arab world (the League of Arab States), as well as in South-East Asia (the ASEAN). Chapter 6 - Human rights in conflict and post-conflict contexts The focus shifts to the national level, in particular to situations of armed conflict and to post-conflict scenarios. Issues related to the standards and procedures of International Humanitarian Law and International Criminal Law are also tackled. Chapter 7 - Human rights promotion and protection at the National and sub-national level This Chapter addresses a number of issues related to the role of National Human Rights Institutions and other actors involved in human rights policies nationwide and at the local/community levels, such as local governments and municipalities. Chapter 8 - The driving forces of human rights promotion: the role of civil society The Chapter focuses on civil society organisations and networks. The analysis looks into the multifaceted strategies carried out by non-state actors, especially in relation to the international instances of human rights protection. Chapter 9 - Conclusions: perspectives on global human rights A summary and discussion of the multi-level dimensions of human rights protection dealt with in the previous chapters. This final segment provides some closing critical reflections on the questions set forth in Chapter 1. Mid 遯ｶ骰稿rm homework At the end of chapter 4, the instructions for homework will be released: homework must be submitted by the end of chapter 6 (2 weeks). Homework consists of writing a communication or a petition addressed to one of the monitoring bodies studied in the first four chapters. The aim is to familiarise students with the tools of human rights protection mechanisms. The texts will be evaluated using a peer review methodology. Final homework At the end of chapter 8, the instructions for homework will be released: homework must be submitted in 2 weeks. Students will be asked to write, using a simplified form, a project addressing a human rights related issue that is challenging their town, territory, home country and likely to be taken up by governmental or non-governmental agencies. Within each chapter, the MOOC offers tailored case-studies, interviews with field experts, officers and academics.

Do you feel the need to have a clearer understanding of it, beyond the conventional language of media and social networks? Well, this course might provide the help and the stimulus you are looking for. About this course Course Summary This course is designed as a vocabulary of the main terms used by all of us when talking about local as well as world politics; terms which we often use without a proper awareness of their meanings and connections, a circumstance not exactly helpful to any attempt at understanding how politics really works, regardless of our wishful thinking or simplistic morality or easy cynicism. Now, if we want to get deeper into the workings of politics - the only serious starting point for those who want to reform it - we must agree to begin with very abstract notions, that is with the general definitions of what politics, conflict, power (incl. force/violence), and what legitimate power mean (Part 1: What is Politics?). On these premises we will then explain the still main political institution, the state, and peer into the dynamics of war and peace that has dominated the relationships between the states (Part 2: How Does Politics Work?). Since with economic globalization, which has restricted the room for political action, things are getting much more complicated on the planet, and more challenging outside of it (man-made climate change starts in the atmosphere), classical notions have to be rethought. The very nature of the threats endangering our global commons does not leave the definition of politics (Part 3: World Politics and the Future). This course does not aim at communicating any \'message\' as to how politics ought to be, but it will obviously try to clarify the main concepts - freedom, equality, justice - we make use of while talking about values and principles in politics; this is what is called \'normative political philosophy\' and is regarded here as an important chapter of political philosophy, not the whole of it (Part 4: Ethics and Politics). What will I learn? At the end of the course you may have achieved a clearer and less confused awareness of the political vocabulary, thus gaining a more complex, more autonomous and more critical understanding of political processes. If you are a student of political science, law, sociology and economics you may get better tools for catching the overarching sense of processes that you do otherwise approach in a fragmented perspective. What do I have to know? Due to my conceptual approach, to follow this course you do not need a prior knowledge of philosophy or political science, just the degree of general culture needed to pass the final high school exam, be it Abitur, maturit�ｾ�ｿｽ, baccalaur�ｾ�ｽｩat or 鬯ｮ蛟ｩ�ｿｽ�ｿｽ(gao kao).

To transform a place into a state of mind.','Stefano Mirti, Anne-Sophie Gauvin, and Petronela Nita Architecture 101 - Part I From nothingness to place: To learn to stare, observe and see places like architects do. To transform a place into a state of mind. About this course Architecture 101: Architecture to convert a place into a state of mind. Apparently a simple task, actually a fairly tricky operation. To (try to) understand, we split our journey into three parts. This course is about part 1: from nothingness to place (part 2 is from place to space, part 3 is from space to architecture). What is a place? What is space? How do we make space? How do we prepare our mind to make space? Without a concept, we can遯ｶ蜀ｲ have a place. Without a place, we can遯ｶ蜀ｲ have space. Without a space, we can遯ｶ蜀ｲ have architecture... If we want to create space, in the first instance, it has to happen in our mind. When a conceptual vision takes form in our minds, a place (with its own spatial features) is born. Architecture 101 is an introduction to space and architecture through 101 exercises. A six-month journey divided into 3 courses 遯ｶ蠕冢line遯ｶ�ｿｽ on iversity (part 1, part 2 and part 3), one final exhibition / graduation party. If you are still alive after all of this daunting process, there will be a one-week workshop 遯ｶ蠕冉fline遯ｶ�ｿｽ, where we will go one step beyond. In short: Part 1: From Nothingness to Place (Jan 5 to Feb 28, we will work in 2d) Part 2: From Place to Space (Mar 2 to Apr 25, we will work in 3d) Part 3: From Space to Architecture (Apr 27 to Jun 20, we will work in scale 1 to 1) Exhibition / Graduation at Abadir, in Sicily (Jun 19 to Jun 21, we set up our fancy exhibition) Workshop: Architecture 101 Summer Camp at Abadir, in Sicily (Jun 22 to Jun 26, we build for real). Architecture 101 (part 1: from nothingness to place) To start our journey, we will deal with the absence of space and place. Something that could be defined as 遯ｶ蠕柞thingness遯ｶ�ｿｽ. As Ang Lee or Paul Valery would respectively say : 遯ｶ蠑吃e source of all the material comes from nothingness.遯ｶ�ｿｽ 遯ｶ蟒ｨod made everything out of nothing, but the nothingness shows through.遯ｶ�ｿｽ In a different way, Ludwig Wittgenstein taught us that when things have no name, they don遯ｶ蜀ｲ exist. Hence in order to understand things, we have to start with worlds in which things have no name. Pieces of music without sound. Televisions without signal. We will go through the process of shaping meaning. Articulate and complex meanings, defining relationships between mind and bodies, bodies and places. Little by little, we will encounter places and see the world taking shape. All of this, using a 遯ｶ蠕Ｂnds-on遯ｶ�ｿｽ system (you will by doing). Course Structure Week 1: taking pictures Week 2: learning to sketch Week 3: making collages Week 4: observing the weather Week 5: shaping diagrams Week 6: drawing maps Week 7: passing an exam Week 8: taking a break Learning Objectives To see places like architects do. To understand the principles upon which we convert a place into a state of mind. We will explore nothingness, void and negative space. We will learn to name things, we will learn how to invent place (as we wrote before, when things have no name, they cannot exist). We will learn to stare, observe and see. We will learn a significative amount of extremely interesting (and totally useless) things. All of the above refers to the conceptual part of our course. Then, since we love having our students making practical things, you will also learn lots of technical things using a number of interesting applications. At the end, what do I make? A booklet (with a given proportion, size, appearance) where you will collect all of your visual experiments. Each booklet devoted to a specific 遯ｶ蠕詫ace遯ｶ�ｿｽ. If one thousand people finish this part 1, we will have a fabulous collection of 1000 booklets. Prior Knowledge Important thing! In terms of prior knowledge, nothing in particular is required. However, in terms of technical equipment, this course will be easier to follow for those with access to a smartphone or tablet. We shaped this course for a very specific kind of student. Our imaginary student is a gent (or gentle lady) who accesses our content via his/her smartphone. Of course you can follow us via a desktop, make homework at home on your table. Yet, the way we intended the whole thing is for someone who takes the whole course (including doing homework) via a smartphone (or tablet). Workload Between 3 and 7 hours a week. From Monday to Friday, for a total of 6 weeks, you will receive an email with a 15 second-video to watch (to get you in the mood), and a pdf with some instructions for completing an assignment and a series of references (to go deeper in the subject at hand).

About this course Course Summary This MOOC is an introduction in Critical Thinking, with an emphasis on using reason in our daily communication. Its main topics cover the structure and analysis of arguments, the study of inductive reasoning as basis for scientific knowledge and as key ingredient in how we understand reality. Next we will focus on fallacies (like loaded question or hasty generalization) and on guidelines for structuring a presentation, an argumentative essay or a debate. Furthermore, the course gives you an overview of cognitive biases (a fashionable topic nowadays), and on the use of emotional tools in persuasion. The teaching is accompanied by tons of documented experiments and fun examples, guided practice, quizzes, links to additional materials (like TED talks) and short homework. What do I learn? After taking this course you will have the tools to analyze the truth of all kinds of statements, from opinion articles to court verdicts and investment proposals. You will better understand the philosophical basis of human knowledge, also you will be more persuasive in domestic talks as well as in good structured presentations, debates or argumentative essays. Furthermore, a main goal of this course is that you will be able to recognize and refute the most common fallacies (reasoning errors), and understand irrational behavior. What do I need to know? No prior knowledge is needed for this course, participants should only come equipped with natural curiosity and a respect for the truth.

Sign up and learn more about policy advice, political consulting and their impact on governance.','Prof. Dr. Andrea R�ｾ�ｽｶmmele, Henrik Schober, and Eva Savinova Governance & Policy Advice: How Political Decisions Come to Life What happens 遯ｶ隧ｱehind the scenes遯ｶ�ｿｽ of political decisions? Who advises politicians, and how big is their influence? Sign up and learn more about policy advice, political consulting and their impact on governance. About this course Course Summary Political decisions are of course made by governments and/or parliaments. But who provides these bodies with the information they need and shows them the strategic options they have? Who frames political action before the wider public even takes notice of the issue? How does political agenda setting work and what do certain policy outcomes tell us about the future of the issue at stake? This course is designed to outline key features of policy advice and political consulting and their impact on governance. We will observe the key players on the spot as well as those behind the scenes and we will analyze their patterns of interaction. Moreover, we will provide insights regarding essential questions to which there are no single right answers: What role does policy advice play in different democracies? What is good policy advice? What makes an expert? In sum: Whom do (and should) politicians and society listen to, and what do (and should) they make of the advice they receive? What do I learn? By the end of the course, students will know the key concepts of policy advice as well as the main actors in the field and their patterns of interaction. They will understand how and by whom a certain political decision is framed, shaped and implemented. And they will be able to apply this knowledge to a given political event which may affect their own professional or personal life. So, first and foremost, they will be able to ask the right questions. What do I need to know? The course is designed to cater for students and professionals who are interested in decision making, political communication, policy advice, and consulting. Course participants are expected to follow current politics and to be keen on looking at the matter from different (and sometimes unusual) perspectives. Basic knowledge in political science would be an asset.

We will first learn about the basics of DNA and then find out how it allows for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. About this course Course Summary DNA is a molecule that we all encounter every day, one way or the other, often without knowing: We inherit traits from our parents encoded in DNA, diagnostics and forensics (as featured in TV serials like CSI) are often based on DNA, and many incurable diseases are caused by changes in DNA sequences. Based on milestone experiments, using models and whiteboard sequences, we want to convey our fascination for DNA and provide you with basic knowledge of DNA structure and function to better understand biomedical approaches for diagnostics and therapy. What will I learn? Participants will be able to answer the following questions after completing the course: Why and how has DNA become one of the most powerful tools in research? How does DNA look and why is DNA structure so important? What do the terms cell division, mitosis, transcription, translation and mutation mean? Why is it so hard to find a cure for cancer? For which diseases is DNA technology used as a diagnostic tool? For which diseases may DNA-based technology help developing a therapy? What do I have to know? In order to follow our course, basic high school biology and chemistry knowledge is absolutely sufficient. In order to successfully complete all homework assignments, including more in depth questions, you will need some more time and motivation to read further and catch up on certain topics.

We show you the way to get your idea to the app store.','Prof. Dr. Klaus Quibeldey-Cirkel, Christoph Thelen, Andreas G�ｾ�ｽ､rtner, Paul-Christian Volkmer, and Daniel Gerhardt Web Engineering II: Developing Mobile HTML5 Apps Learn how to design and develop a mobile Web app. What about realising a real-time multi-player game? We show you the way to get your idea to the app store. About this course Become familiar with the challenges that come with the planning, development, testing, and maintenance of HTML5 apps. Web Engineering takes you through the concepts, methods, techniques, and tools needed for systematically developing websites and Web applications. In Web Engineering I \"Basics of Web Development\" we learned how to create a professional website, and now we take a step further as you develop your very own HTML5 app! Using the HTML5 mobile application framework Sencha Touch, you will go online and practice handling the infrastructure and tools needed for the development and maintenance of an established Web app. In particular, you will learn the basic technical and architectural principles necessary for Web app building. Course Content Web Engineering II builds upon on the material learned in the first course, Web Engineering I. Each chapter presents the following content through a series of instructional videos, screencasts and online interactive exercises. You will also work in small groups, applying and testing practical examples of key technical aspects in Web development. Chapter 11: Starter Kit: Tools for the HTML5 App in the Cloud Chapter 12: REST Architectural Style for Mobile Web Applications Chapter 13: Interactive Exercises with JavaScript at Codecademy Chapter 14: Single-Page Applications with AJAX, JSON, and REST APIs Chapter 15: Overview of HTML5 and its JavaScript APIs Chapter 16: Exercises with the HTML5 Mobile Application Framework Sencha Touch Chapter 17: Introduction to NoSQL Databases for Web Apps Chapter 18: Full-Stack JavaScript: Design and Implementation of a WebSocket App Chapter 19: Preparing an HTML5 App for App Stores Chapter 20: Screen Casting Web Apps for User Documentation As a learning object for exploring and applying the course content, we will use the mobile Web-based Audience-Response System ARSnova. It will be used as a live feedback app throughout the MOOC. Course Language The official course language is English, but the videos will be in German with English subtitles and slides. This is due to the fact that the course is part of the THM curriculum of Computer Science for German students. Course Structure The entire course consists of two consecutive parts: the first part of the course Web Engineering I, started on 15 October 2013, and this course, Web Engineering II, started on 17 January 2014. Each course consists of 10 chapters with 6 to 8 learning units and has a weekly workload time of about 6 hours. For students at universities, the entire course has a workload equivalent to 6 ECTS credits. With sufficient prior knowledge, you can move directly onto Web Engineering II. Learning Objectives At the end of the two-part course, you will be able to: Develop a high-performance, secure and accessible website, upon a client遯ｶ蜀ｱ request. Design and realise an HTML5 app and upload this to app stores. Who is this course aimed at? Both parts of the MOOC \"Web Engineering\" are aimed at undergraduate students of computer science, including media and business computer science, computer science specialist trainees in the field of application development, and working Web designers. For students of THM in the Department of MNI, the entire MOOC \"Web Engineering\" is equivalent to the Bachelor module \"Internet-Based Systems\" (CS 1024). Prerequisites for Course Participation You must have a working knowledge of HTML/CSS as provided by the track Web Fundamentals from Codecademy. Course Certificates You will receive a certificate for both Web Engineering I and II, if you provide the following: Web Engineering I: completion of the online final exam and creation of a website Web Engineering II: completion of the online final exam and creation of an HTML5 App Our Experience Whoever offers an online course in Web engineering should be able to offer appropriate references as well. In recent years, we have worked in the areas of e-learning and Web-based systems. This includes the university search engine Pharus, the learning and collaboration platform eCollab, and the mobile Audience-Response System ARSnova. These were developed as open source student projects, starting from bachelor and master projects to production. Looking back, it was the course \"Web Engineering\" that adequately prepared students for these developing projects. If you complete both parts of the course Web Engineering I and II, you will be able to do the same.

Do you feel the need to have a clearer understanding of it, beyond the conventional language of media and social networks? Well, this course might provide the help and the stimulus you are looking for.','Prof. Furio Cerutti Political Philosophy: An Introduction Are you interested in politics? Do you feel the need to have a clearer understanding of it, beyond the conventional language of media and social networks? Well, this course might provide the help and the stimulus you are looking for. About this course Course Summary This course is designed as a vocabulary of the main terms used by all of us when talking about local as well as world politics; terms which we often use without a proper awareness of their meanings and connections, a circumstance not exactly helpful to any attempt at understanding how politics really works, regardless of our wishful thinking or simplistic morality or easy cynicism. Now, if we want to get deeper into the workings of politics - the only serious starting point for those who want to reform it - we must agree to begin with very abstract notions, that is with the general definitions of what politics, conflict, power (incl. force/violence), and what legitimate power mean (Part 1: What is Politics?). On these premises we will then explain the still main political institution, the state, and peer into the dynamics of war and peace that has dominated the relationships between the states (Part 2: How Does Politics Work?). Since with economic globalization, which has restricted the room for political action, things are getting much more complicated on the planet, and more challenging outside of it (man-made climate change starts in the atmosphere), classical notions have to be rethought. The very nature of the threats endangering our global commons does not leave the definition of politics (Part 3: World Politics and the Future). This course does not aim at communicating any \'message\' as to how politics ought to be, but it will obviously try to clarify the main concepts - freedom, equality, justice - we make use of while talking about values and principles in politics; this is what is called \'normative political philosophy\' and is regarded here as an important chapter of political philosophy, not the whole of it (Part 4: Ethics and Politics). What will I learn? At the end of the course you may have achieved a clearer and less confused awareness of the political vocabulary, thus gaining a more complex, more autonomous and more critical understanding of political processes. If you are a student of political science, law, sociology and economics you may get better tools for catching the overarching sense of processes that you do otherwise approach in a fragmented perspective. What do I have to know? Due to my conceptual approach, to follow this course you do not need a prior knowledge of philosophy or political science, just the degree of general culture needed to pass the final high school exam, be it Abitur, maturit�ｾ�ｿｽ, baccalaur�ｾ�ｽｩat or 鬯ｮ蛟ｩ�ｿｽ�ｿｽ(gao kao).

Martin Lindner, and Lutz Berger Mathematik Online-Kurs - Mathematisch denken! Methodisch ausgefeilter Doppel-MOOC mit Geometrie und Arithmetik. Du m�ｾ�ｽｶchtest mathematisch denken lernen? Sei Kiebitz, Anpacker oder Formalisierer: Du hast die Wahl! About this course Kursbeschreibung Mathematik: das ist Freude am Denken! Und mathematisch denken kann jeder! Wer an diesem Kurs teilnimmt, erh�ｾ�ｽ､lt seine regelm�ｾ�ｽ､�ｾ�谿トe Dosis an meditativen Denkaufgaben, spannenden Knobeleien und mathematischen Einsichten. In den Inhaltsgebieten Arithmetik und Geometrie werden mathematische Denk- und Arbeitsweisen vermittelt, beispielsweise Probleml�ｾ�ｽｶsen, Begriffe definieren und S�ｾ�ｽ､tze finden und beweisen. Was lerne ich in diesem Kurs? Im ersten Kursblock werden wir uns mit folgenden Fragen befassen: Wie definiert man mathematische Begriffe? Wie findet man eigentlich mathematische Gesetzm�ｾ�ｽ､�ｾ�谿トkeiten? Und wie beweist man diese? Welche Rolle spielen Annahmen in der Mathematik? Wie baut sich das Geb�ｾ�ｽ､ude der Mathematik aus Definitionen, Annahmen und Gesetzm�ｾ�ｽ､�ｾ�谿�ikeiten auf? Fragen �ｾ�ｽｼber Fragen, denen wir uns mit zahlreichen Experimenten widmen. Im zweiten Kursblock werden wir die Denk- und Arbeitsweisen aus dem ersten Block in verschiedenen Gebieten anwenden und dadurch festigen. In der Geometrie werden wir uns mit der T�ｾ�ｽ､tigkeit des Messens und dem Abstandsbegriff, mit Strecken, Halbgeraden und Geraden, mit Ebenen und Halbenenen und mit Winkeln befassen. In der Arithmetik schauen wir uns den Begriff der Teilbarkeit n�ｾ�ｽ､her an, veranschaulichen Begriffe wie \"gr�ｾ�ｽｶ�ｾ�谿ｳer gemeinsamer Teiler\" und \"kleinstes gemeinsames Vielfaches\", untersuchen Primzahlen und Primfaktorzerlegungen und experimentieren mit Stellenwertsystemen. Im dritten Kursblock befassen wir uns mit grundlegenden mathematischen Konzepten: Was sind Mengen, Relationen und Funktionen? Auch hier werden wir uns den Begriffen und ihren Zusammenh�ｾ�ｽ､ngen mit grundlegenden mathematischen Denk- und Arbeitsweisen n�ｾ�ｽ､hern. Experimentieren, erforschen, untersuchen, ergr�ｾ�ｽｼnden, Vermutungen anstellen, Vermutungen verwerfen, Vermutungen beweisen. Im vierten und letzten Kursblock machen wir uns noch einmal an zentrale Gesetzm�ｾ�ｽ､�ｾ�谿トkeiten der Mathematik. Wie findet man solche Gesetzm�ｾ�ｽ､�ｾ�谿�ikeiten, und wie beweist man sie? In der Geometrie schauen wir uns schicke S�ｾ�ｽ､tze am Kreis an, in der Arithmetik nicht weniger schicke S�ｾ�ｽ､tze der Zahlentheorie. Mathematik pur, Mathematik anschaulich, Mathematik handgemacht. Welche Vorkenntnisse ben�ｾ�ｽｶtige ich? Jede/r kann mitmachen, der mathematische Vorkenntnisse aus dem Gymnasium mitbringt. Und wenn Du nicht auf dem Gymnasium warst, aber gerne mitmachen m�ｾ�ｽｶchtest: Dann trau dich! Man sollte nat�ｾ�ｽｼrlich schon mal mit Geometrie und Algebra zu tun gehabt haben. Vieles wird dann wieder aufgefrischt, denn wir machen dann nicht auf dem Niveau der 12. oder 13. Klasse weiter, sondern bauen die Teilgebiete, in denen wir arbeiten, noch einmal grundlegend auf. Oberstufenwissen zu Analysis und Linearer Algebra ist nicht notwendig! Wie hoch ist der Arbeitsaufwand Du kannst dich entscheiden, wie aktiv Du dich in den Kurs einbringen m�ｾ�ｽｶchtest - je nach Interesse und Ehrgeiz! 1) Kiebitze wollen \"nur mal gucken\" oder mit dem mathematischen Denken erst einmal warm werden. Kiebitze schnuppern jede Woche in den Kurs, schauen sich eins, zwei Videos an und st�ｾ�ｽｶbern vielleicht einmal in den weiterf�ｾ�ｽｼhrenden Bereichen. Hierdurch bekommen sie einen Einblick, was mathematisches Denken bedeutet, und sie erhalten Impulse, wo man Mathematik auch im Alltag findet und gebrauchen kann. Vielleicht bekommen sie dabei sogar Lust auf mehr! Aufwand: ca. 1-2 Stunden pro Woche 2) Anpacker legen Hand an und erforschen aktiv Mathematik, haben aber keine rechte Lust auf zu viele Formeln. F�ｾ�ｽｼr Anpacker hei�ｾ�谿ｳ es: �ｾσｲmel hochkrempeln! Im MOOC lernen sie, wie man mathematische Situationen systematisch erforscht, wie man anschauliche Begr�ｾ�ｽｼndungen f�ｾ�ｽｼr mathematische Gesetzm�ｾ�ｽ､�ｾ�谿�ikeiten finden kann, und sie erhalten einen Einblick darin, wie man Abstraktes konkretisiert (und umgekehrt). Sie entwickeln ihre Vorstellungskraft zur L�ｾ�ｽｶsung mathematischer Probleme weiter und lernen, Vermutungen anhand konkreter Modelle zu untersuchen. Aufwand: ca. 3-4 Stunden pro Woche 3) Formalisierer geben sich mit der Anschauung nicht zufrieden - sie wollen Formeln sehen! Formalisierer sind Anpacker, die zus�ｾ�ｽ､tzlich auch noch das Spiel mit abstrakter Symbolsprache lieben. Sie lernen, formale Definitionen zu fassen und formale Beweise zu f�ｾ�ｽｼhren. Nat�ｾ�ｽｼrlich immer basierend auf tragf�ｾ�ｽ､higen Vorstellungen, die sie mit den Anpackern teilen! Aufwand: ca. 7-8 Stunden pro Woche Du m�ｾ�ｽｶchtest ein Kiebitz in der Arithmetik sein, aber ein Anpacker in der Geometrie? Oder ein Formalisierer in der Arithmetik, aber ein Kiebitz in der Geometrie? Kein Problem - alles ist m�ｾ�ｽｶglich! So kannst Du deinen individuellen Aufwand selbst w�ｾ�ｽ､hlen und dir diejenigen Inhalte zusammenstellen, die dich interessieren. Erhalte ich ein Zertifikat? Du erh�ｾ�ｽ､ltst eine Teilnahmebest�ｾ�ｽ､tigung, wenn du aktiv mitmachst.

Lamentablemente, su repercusi�ｾ�ｽｳn en la pr�ｾ�ｽ｡ctica profesional cotidiana demuestra que cada d�ｾ�ｽｭa dependemos m�ｾ�ｽ｡s de nuevas propuestas para la soluci�ｾ�ｽｳn de problemas, las cuales resultan costosas para ser implantadas en las empresas que los enfrentan. Tal es el caso del Razonamiento o Pensamiento Disruptivo, o el CPS Creative Problem Solving. Es por ello que consideramos urgente que los Modelos Educativos consideren la necesidad de formar a los alumnos en esta l�ｾ�ｽｭnea, y en el caso de las empresas o instituciones, reflexionen acerca de esta problem�ｾ�ｽ｡tica. Las ventajas competitivas del MIRM, son: 1. Englobar, bajo un �ｾ�ｽｺnico enfoque, las diferentes corrientes de pensamiento, como son: Convergente, Divergente o Paralelo, Cr�ｾ�ｽｭtico, Intuitivo, Disruptivo, etc. 2. Ampliar el enfoque del DHP (Desarrollo de Habilidades del Pensamiento), como herramienta de apoyo fundamental. 3. Aplicar el MIRM como alternativa de soluci�ｾ�ｽｳn creativa de los problemas, toda vez que es un Modelo que genera Modelos Estrat�ｾ�ｽｩgicos. 4. Ofrecer, para los que obtengan la certificaci�ｾ�ｽｳn de este curso, materiales online editables y reusables en sus �ｾ�ｽ｡reas profesionales de trabajo, libres de derechos. EL CURSO EST�ｾ�ｿｽ ORIENTADO, A 遯ｶ�ｽ｢ Empresas, Despachos o Instituciones que requieran herramientas formativas y de aplicaci�ｾ�ｽｳn pr�ｾ�ｽ｡ctica en la Soluci�ｾ�ｽｳn Creativa de Problemas. 遯ｶ�ｽ｢ Instituciones promotoras de nuevos e innovadores horizontes educativos. 遯ｶ�ｽ｢ Investigadores Educativos que buscan esquemas propositivos m�ｾ�ｽ｡s eficientes. 遯ｶ�ｽ｢ Universidades que consideren factible el reorientar el rumbo de sus esquemas de investigaci�ｾ�ｽｳn educativa, impulsando el propio desarrollo de Objetos de Conocimiento (construidos con herramientas de lenguajes de programaci�ｾ�ｽｳn) 遯ｶ�ｽ｢ Desarrolladores de software interesados en participar en propuestas v�ｾ�ｽｭa online, aportando recursos abiertos disponibles para uso gratuito universal. 遯ｶ�ｽ｢ Maestros y alumnos preocupados por la dispersi�ｾ�ｽｳn agravada de los modelos actuales que siguen privilegiando la memorizaci�ｾ�ｽｳn y no el razonamiento.

About this course Kursbeschreibung Die Deadline f�ｾ�ｽｼr einen wichtigen Auftrag r�ｾ�ｽｼckt immer n�ｾ�ｽ､her oder es gilt eine schwierige Pflichtklausur im Studium zu meistern. Eigentlich sollten Sie bereits lernen oder arbeiten, doch jeden Tag schaffen Sie es, sich mit anderen 遯ｶ讙彿chtigen遯ｶ�ｿｽ Aufgaben wie Putzen oder Internetsurfen zu besch�ｾ�ｽ､ftigen. Doch die Zeit wird knapper und der Druck immer gr�ｾ�ｽｶ�ｾ�豁ｹr遯ｶ�ｽｦ Prokrastination oder 遯ｶ證ｸufschieberitis遯ｶ�ｿｽ ist ein Alltagsph�ｾ�ｽ､nomen, das den meisten Menschen bekannt sein d�ｾ�ｽｼrfte: Unangenehme T�ｾ�ｽ､tigkeiten werden lieber erst einmal aufgeschoben, anstatt sie sofort zu erledigen. In acht Wochen vermitteln wir in diesem MOOC die wissenschaftlichen Hintergr�ｾ�ｽｼnde und bieten Unterst�ｾ�ｽｼtzung, das eigene Verhalten zu reflektieren und zu �ｾ�ｽ､ndern! F�ｾ�ｽｼr wen ist dieser Kurs gedacht? Dieser MOOC richtet sich an Personen, die daran interessiert sind ihre Selbstregulationsf�ｾ�ｽ､higkeiten zu verbessern, um sich in Zukunft ein effizienteres Vorgehen in Studium und Beruf zu erarbeiten. Der Kurs zielt nicht nur auf Wissensvermittlung ab, sondern m�ｾ�ｽｶchte Ihnen auch dabei helfen, Ihr Verhalten zu ver�ｾ�ｽ､ndern! Am Ende des Kurses sollten Sie in der Lage sein, diejenigen Strategien in Ihrem Alltag anzuwenden, welche sich f�ｾ�ｽｼr Sie als besonders erfolgsversprechend zeigen. Was lerne ich in diesem Kurs? Am Ende des Kurse - kennen Sie die wichtigsten wissenschaftlichen Hintergr�ｾ�ｽｼnde zum Thema Prokrastination (Modelle & Theorien) - kennen Sie die Konzepte der Selbstkontrolle und Selbstregulation und k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen diese voneinander abgrenzen - sind Sie mit verschiedenen Strategien aus den Bereichen Selbstkontrolle (Planungsf�ｾ�ｽ､higkeit, Zielkontrolle, Arbeitsplatzgestaltung, Startkontrolle, Impulskontrolle) und Selbstregulation (Emotionsregulation, Selbstmotivierung, Umgang mit Ablenkungen, Selbstberuhigung und -aktivierung) vertraut und k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen diese einsetzen Welche Vorkenntnisse ben�ｾ�ｽｶtige ich? Keine 遯ｶ�ｿｽ Sie sollten aber nat�ｾ�ｽｼrlich schon Probleme mit dem Aufschieben haben und daran etwas �ｾ�ｽ､ndern wollen! Wenn Sie Fallschirmspringen wollen, besuchen Sie ja auch keinen Kochkurs, oder? ;-) Allerdings sollten Sie eine gewisse Bereitschaft zur Reflexion des eigenen Verhaltens mitbringen, denn nur wenn Sie sich damit auseinandersetzen, werden Sie die Aufschieberitis in den Griff bekommen! Kurs Struktur Kapitel 1 Willkommen: Sch�ｾ�ｽｶn, dass Sie mit dabei sind! In der ersten Kurswoche m�ｾ�ｽｶchten wir Sie mit dem Ph�ｾ�ｽ､nomen der Aufschieberitis vertraut machen. Wir erl�ｾ�ｽ､utern Ihnen die unterschiedlichen Auspr�ｾ�ｽ､gungen von Aufschiebeverhalten und geben einen ersten �ｾ�蠖册rblick dar�ｾ�ｽｼber, was Sie in den kommenden Wochen erwartet. Au�ｾ�豁ｹrdem haben Sie die M�ｾ�ｽｶglichkeit Ihr individuelles Prokrastinationsprofil zu ermitteln. Kapitel 2 Volition & Motivation: Nach einem ersten �ｾ�蠖册rblick steigen wir nun tiefer in die Theorie zur Prokrastination ein. Welche Modelle, Theorien und Erkl�ｾ�ｽ､rungsans�ｾ�ｽ､tze gibt es? Ist alles nur eine Frage der Motivation? Au�ｾ�豁ｹrdem erfahren Sie alles zum Unterschied zwischen Selbstregulation und Selbstkontrolle, denn dieser Logik folgt auch der Aufbau des Trainings. Kapitel 3 Grundlagen der Selbstkontrolle: Genug mit Theorie, nun geht es in die Praxis und wir beginnen mit den Grundlagen der Selbstkontrolle. Hierbei handelt es sich um grunds�ｾ�ｽ､tzliche Schritte zur Vorbereitung auf die im n�ｾ�ｽ､chsten Kapitel folgenden Strategien. Konkret geht es bei den Grundlagen zur Selbstkontrolle um Zeitmanagement und den Umgang mit komplexen Zielen und Aufgaben. Kapitel 4 Strategien der Selbstkontrolle: Diese Woche steht ganz im Zeichen der Selbstkontrolltechniken. Wir behandeln die Themen Planungsf�ｾ�ｽ､higkeit (Gesamtplanung, Tagesplanung, Planung einer Arbeitseinheit), Zielkontrolle (wie behalten Sie das Ziel im Auge), Arbeitsplatzgestaltung, das p�ｾ�ｽｼnktliche Beginnen sowie die Impulskontrolle. Kapitel 5 Grundlagen der Selbstregulation: Ebenso wie zuvor bei der Selbstkontrolle wenden wir uns nun zuerst wieder den Grundlagen zu, diesmal jenen der Selbstregulation. Das Stichwort lautet hier \"Selbstwahrnehmung\", denn bevor wir uns aktiv regulieren, m�ｾ�ｽｼssen wir zun�ｾ�ｽ､chst einmal feststellen wie unser aktueller Zustand ist. In diesem Kapitel geht es prim�ｾ�ｽ､r um die Wahrnehmung von Emotionen, Zielen, Motiven und Bed�ｾ�ｽｼrfnissen. Kapitel 6 Strategien der Selbstregulation I: Da die Strategien zur Selbstregulation recht umfangreich und etwas komplexer sind, erwarten Sie gleich zwei Kapitel zu diesem Thema. Im ersten Teil erl�ｾ�ｽ､utern wir Ihnen verschiedene Techniken zur Aufmerksamkeitslenkung bzw. dem Umgang mit Ablenkungen. Au�ｾ�豁ｹrdem stellen wir Ihnen 7 Strategien zur Selbstmotivierung vor. Kapitel 7 Strategien der Selbstregulation II: Wie angek�ｾ�ｽｼndigt nun Teil II mit Strategien zur Emotionsregulation sowie Techniken zu Selbstberuhigung und -aktivierung. Sie erfahren wie Sie mit negativen Emotionen umgehen und was Sie aktiv dagegen tun k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen wenn Sie entweder zu m�ｾ�ｽｼde oder zu angespannt f�ｾ�ｽｼr Ihre anstehenden Aufgaben sind. Au�ｾ�豁ｹrdem m�ｾ�ｽｶchten wir Ihnen ein paar Tipps zum Umgang mit Erfolg und Misserfolg mit auf den Weg geben. Kapitel 8 Abschluss: Herzlichen Gl�ｾ�ｽｼckwunsch, Sie haben es geschafft! Schade dass wir uns schon von Ihnen verabschieden m�ｾ�ｽｼssen. Abschlie�ｾ�豁ｹnd haben Sie nun die M�ｾ�ｽｶglichkeit, erneut Ihr Prokrastinationsprofil zu erstellen. Nun k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen Sie anhand Ihrer Werte zu Beginn ermitteln, in welchen Punkten Sie sich verbessert haben oder wo evtl. noch Trainingsbedarf besteht.

Und sei es nur, um eine ordentliche Hausarbeit schreiben zu k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen. Wissenschaft ist nicht nur eine Frage der richtigen Ausbildung, sondern auch der richtigen Denkhaltung. About this course Kursbeschreibung Wir m�ｾ�ｽｶchten mit Ihnen das wissenschaftliche Denken, Arbeiten und Schreiben entwickeln. Der Kurs beginnt philosophisch. Wir werden er�ｾ�ｽｶrtern, was Wissenschaft tut und wie sie sich vom Alltagswissen unterscheidet. Danach wird es aber schnell praktisch und wir f�ｾ�ｽｼhren Sie zu einer eigenen kleinen Hausarbeit nach universit�ｾ�ｽ､ren Standards. Alle Grundtechniken wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens von Zitation bis Datenerhebung werden hierbei vermittelt, wir sprechen dabei auch �ｾ�ｽｼber Lerntypen und Arbeitsorganisation. Ist dieser Kurs etwas f�ｾ�ｽｼr mich? Der Kurs richtet sich an Sch�ｾ�ｽｼler, die schon mal ein Gef�ｾ�ｽｼhl f�ｾ�ｽｼr wissenschaftliche Methoden entwickeln wollen, sowie an Studienanf�ｾ�ｽ､nger, die ihn erg�ｾ�ｽ､nzend zu den Angeboten ihres Studiengangs belegen k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen. Aber auch Master-Studierende, deren Einf�ｾ�ｽｼhrungskurse in das Wissenschaftliche Arbeiten schon eine Weile zur�ｾ�ｽｼckliegen, k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen ihre Kenntnisse in diesem Kurs auffrischen.

Wir richten uns mit dem Kurs aber vor allem an nicht-naturwissenschaftliche Studieng�ｾ�ｽ､nge. Was werde ich lernen? Warum und wie man Wissenschaft betreiben kann, Wie man eine Hausarbeit schreibt (Thema, Recherche, Auswertung, Schreiben) Wie man mit der eigenen Arbeitsweise zum Erfolg kommt. Wie man richtig zitiert und Quellenangaben macht. Wie und warum man Daten sammelt und auswertet, um bestimmte Fragen zu beantworten. Welches Vorwissen brauche ich?

Schule im Aufbruch. Neue Lernkultur selber machen.','Monia Ben Larbi, Prof. Dr. Gerald H�ｾ�ｽｼther, Prof. Dr. Stephan Breidenbach, and Claudia Morten Meine Schule transformieren 遯ｶ�ｿｽ ein Reisef�ｾ�ｽｼhrer Dieser Kurs konzentriert sich auf den Prozess der Ver�ｾ�ｽ､nderung an Schulen, durchzogen von Exkursen zu relevanten Aspekten der Potenzialentfaltung. Schule im Aufbruch. Neue Lernkultur selber machen. About this course Kursbeschreibung Eine Lernkultur der Potenzialentfaltung bedeutet ein individuelles Lernen in einer unterst�ｾ�ｽｼtzenden Gemeinschaft. Kinder lernen nicht nur, Wissen zu reproduzieren, sondern Verantwortung zu �ｾ�ｽｼbernehmen, zusammen zu arbeiten, ihre Pers�ｾ�ｽｶnlichkeit kennen zu lernen und zu entwickeln und sich Wissen selbstst�ｾ�ｽ､ndig anzueignen, im eigenen Rhythmus dem eigenen Lernstil entsprechend. Eine neue Lernkultur ber�ｾ�ｽｼhrt daher die ganze Schule: ihre Strukturen, das Selbstverst�ｾ�ｽ､ndnis der Erwachsenen, die genutzten Lernmaterialien, die Raumaufteilung... Hierbei handelt es sich nicht um eine verordnete, extern gesteuerte Reform, sondern um eine Transformation der Schulen von innen heraus. Hierbei gibt es auch kein vorgegebenes Modell, sondern Schulen haben das Privileg und die Herausforderung, ihre eigenen �ｾ�蠖册rzeugungen umzusetzen. Hierzu gibt es inzwischen viele Vorbilder, Schulen, die aufgebrochen sind und den Mut haben, es anders zu versuchen. Dieser Kurs befasst sich weniger mit der Lernkultur der Potenzialentfaltung, �ｾ�ｽｼber die es viel von anderen Schulen zu lernen gibt. Der Fokus liegt auf der Erm�ｾ�ｽ､chtigung zur Transformation: wie gestalte ich an meiner Schule den Aufbruch mit? Wie fange ich an? Welche Schritte m�ｾ�ｽｼssen gegangen werden? Woran kann es liegen, wenn es nicht l�ｾ�ｽ､uft? Wie gestalte ich Zusammenarbeit? Wie entwickle ich ein Konzept? Wie integriere ich kontinuierliche Ver�ｾ�ｽ､nderung in den Schulalltag? Der Kurs ist in 12 Themen untergliedert, wobei jede Woche ein Thema f�ｾ�ｽｼr Sie freigeschaltet wird. Sie finden in jeder Woche einen Exkurs von Prof. Gerald H�ｾ�ｽｼther zu einem Aspekt der neuen Lernkultur. Die weiteren Inhalte sind in kurze Texte und erkl�ｾ�ｽ､rende Videos aufbereitet, die ebenfalls bewusst kurz gehalten sind, um Ihnen gr�ｾ�ｽｶ�ｾ�豁ｹre Flexibilit�ｾ�ｽ､t bei der Zeiteinteilung zu erm�ｾ�ｽｶglichen. Im Zentrum des Kurses stehen die Aufgaben und der Austausch untereinander. Sie werden jede Woche zu drei Aufgaben aufgefordert: eine Wissensaufgabe, ein kleiner Denkauftrag; eine Herzaufgabe, die die Selbstreflexion im Zentrum hat; und eine Handaufgabe, die eine konkrete Handlung direkt an Ihrer Schule beinhaltet. Ihre Gedanken und Erfahrungen teilen Sie dann mit den anderen Teilnehmenden. Dieser Kurs kann mit einer kostenfreien Teilnahmebest�ｾ�ｽ､tigung abgeschlossen werden, wenn Sie 80% des Materials gesichtet und an den Quizz-Fragen (oftmals mit Augenzwinkern) teilgenommen haben. Kursstruktur Woche 1: \"Fertig machen zum Start\". Einander, den Kurs und diese Plattform kennenlernen. Woche 2: \"Ein Prozess? Dein Prozess!\". Alles �ｾ�ｽｼber Prozesse und worauf man achten kann, wenn man sie gestalten m�ｾ�ｽｶchte. Woche 3: \"Einer f�ｾ�ｽ､ngt an\". Wie ich an meiner Schule Mitstreiter*innen finde. Woche 4: \"St�ｾ�ｽ､rken & Tr�ｾ�ｽ､ume\". Das Potenzial der Schule mit einer gemeinsamen Vision als Fundament der Transformation. Woche 5: \"Gemeinschaft\". Weil Zusammenarbeit nicht ganz von alleine toll wird, man aber viel daf�ｾ�ｽｼr tun kann. Woche 6: \"Information\". Sich von anderen inspirieren lassen und die Rahmenbedingungen verstehen. Woche 7: \"Essenz\". Alles noch mal auf den Punkt bringen als dauerhafte Orientierung. Woche 8: \"Design\". Ein neues Konzept f�ｾ�ｽｼr unsere Schule. Woche 9: \"Umsetzung\". Machen, machen, weitermachen oder habe einen Plan und alles kommt anders. Woche 10: \"Feiern\". Weil es Teil der Arbeit ist und wir es so sehr verdienen. Woche 11: \"Lernende Schule\". Nach der Transformation ist vor der Transformation. Woche 12: \"Pers�ｾ�ｽｶnliches Lernen & Transfer\". Wie es nach diesem Kurs weiter geht. Was lerne ich in diesem Kurs? In diesem Kurs k�ｾ�ｽｶnnen Sie... ... ein Grundverst�ｾ�ｽ､ndnis von Prozessen, ihrer Logik und Gestaltungsm�ｾ�ｽｶglichkeiten erlangen; ... eine gro�ｾ�豁ｹ Vielfalt von Methoden f�ｾ�ｽｼr den Transformationsprozess kennenlernen; ... eine Orientierungshilfe der verschiedenen Schritte von Schulentwicklung mitnehmen; ... ihr eigenes Handeln und Ihre Haltung reflektieren; ... viel �ｾ�ｽｼber Zusammenarbeit lernen; ... Mut finden, an Ihrer Schule anzufangen; ... sich mit Menschen mit �ｾ�ｽ､hnlichen Visionen austauschen und verbinden; ... mit Grundwerkzeugen der lernenden Schule vertraut werden. Welche Vorkenntnisse brauche ich f�ｾ�ｽｼr diesen Kurs? Die Teilnahme erfordert keinerlei Vorwissen. Die Anbindung an eine Schule ist jedoch sehr hilfreich, da jede Woche eine Aufgabe direkt an der Schule zu bearbeiten ist.
