(540, 'Probabilistic Graphical Models', 'In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques.', 'What are Probabilistic Graphical Models?\n Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.\nIn this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques; you will also learn algorithms for using a PGM to reach conclusions about the world from limited and noisy evidence, and for making good decisions under uncertainty. The class covers both the theoretical underpinnings of the PGM framework and practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVMBe50GfnI', '2013-04-08', 11, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/pgm/large-icon.png', 'ComSci: AI', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Stanford University', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

Like its parent course, this shorter course covers the organization and physiology of the human central nervous system. The focus of Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action is on the basic components of the brain and spinal cord, the means by which nerve cells generate electrical signals and communicate, the neural mechanisms of synaptic and circuit plasticity, and the organization of the sensory and motor systems that integrate experience and motivate behavior. Unlike its parent course, this shorter course is not so clinically focused. Rather, it aims to explore foundational mechanisms in neuroscience without emphasizing the competency of localizing lesions in the human central nervous system (a major focus of Medical Neuroscience).\n\n \n\nThe overall goal of this course is to equip learners to be successful in our specialization, Perception, Action and the Brain. To help you get the most out of our specialization, this course will teach you the basic neural mechanisms that makes it possible for the human brain to contend with an onslaught of sensory signals and generate successful behavior for survival and flourishing in a complex world. Thus, the other two courses in Perception, Action and the Brain will introduce you to the phenomenology of what we see and the means by which the brain generates visual representations (Visual Perception and the Brain), and challenge you to understand how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities (The Brain and Space). The role, then, of Foundational Neuroscience for Perception and Action is to give you a "look under the hood" so that you can understand the neural mechanisms that operate at the level of synapses, circuits, and sensorimotor systems. You will then use this intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the human central nervous system as you take on the final project in our specialization.\n\n \n\nThis course is for advanced baccalaureate and prospective or current graduate students who are pursuing degrees in the brain sciences. It is also for students or professionals in technical fields concerned with human factors in computing, virtual reality, or gaming who are interested in understanding how the brain generates perceptions and actions. Teachers who are interested in understanding how the brain works as a means to enhance their curriculum in science education, or just to enhance student learning more generally will benefit.

(552, 'Automata', 'This course covers finite automata, context-free grammars, Turing machines, undecidable problems, and intractable problems (NP-completeness).', 'I am pleased to be able to offer free over the Internet a course on Automata Theory, based on the material I have taught periodically at Stanford in the course CS154. Participants have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. You will need a decent Internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.\nThe course covers four broad areas: (1) Finite automata and regular expressions, (2) Context-free grammars, (3) Turing machines and decidability, and (4) the theory of intractability, or NP-complete problems. Why Study Automata Theory? This subject is not just for those planning to enter the field of complexity theory, although it is a good place to start if that is your goal. Rather, the course will emphasize those aspects of the theory that people really use in practice. Finite automata, regular expressions, and context-free grammars are ideas that have stood the test of time. They are essential tools for compilers. But more importantly, they are used in many systems that require input that is less general than a full programming language yet more complex than "push this button." The concepts of undecidable problems and intractable problems serve a different purpose. Undecidable problems are those for which no computer solution can ever exist, while intractable problems are those for which there is strong evidence that, although they can be solved by a computer, they cannot be solved sufficiently fast that the solution is truly useful in practice. Understanding this theory, and in particular being able to prove that a problem you are facing belongs to one of these classes, allows you to justify taking another approach 窶� simplifying the problem or writing code to approximate the solution, for example. During the course, I''m going to prove a number of things. The purpose of these proofs is not to torture you or confuse you. Neither are the proofs there because I doubt you would believe me were I merely to state some well-known fact. Rather, understanding how these proofs, especially inductive proofs, work, lets you think more clearly about your own work. I do not advocate proofs that programs are correct, but whenever you attempt something a bit complex, it is good to have in mind the inductive proofs that would be needed to guarantee that what you are doing really works in all cases.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/automata', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb_2HdsqypI', '2015-09-12', 6, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/automata/large-icon.png', 'ComSci: Theory', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Stanford University', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the\npolitical and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental\nempire in the nineteenth century, but ultimately that system had to be\ndestroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power. \n \nWhy that was 窶� why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s 窶� is a\nmatter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the\ncourse.

This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises.

This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience.

The course will focus on the following topics:\n\n Brain death and persistent vegetative state \n When is a person dead? In many countries death is now defined as 窶彙rain death,窶� but is this way of understanding death justified? How we define death is important, because it is connected to critical questions such as: When is organ donation permissible?\nWhen is it right to take someone off life support? And how should we treat individuals who are in a persistent vegetative state?\n \n Abortion and the moral status of embryos and fetus \n Most people would argue that it is always wrong to intentionally take the life of an innocent human being. This belief is often expressed in terms of support for the 窶徭anctity of human life.窶� Is abortion or embryo research compatible with this idea? Does\nan embryo have a right to life from the beginning of conception, or is this right something it acquires gradually? When, if ever, is abortion justified?\n \n Making end of life decisions \n How do you distinguish wrongful killing from acts that are not regarded as wrong? Can it ever be right to end the life of someone who cannot express a view about whether he or she wants to live or die? How should we make life and death decisions for severely\nill infants? And can euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide be justified?\n \n Effective altruism\n\n We all spend money on items that are not necessities. In other parts of the world, people die for the want of food or medicines that cost a few cents. The common view is that giving to poor people in other countries is charity, something that is good\nto do, but not wrong if we don窶冲. But is that really true? This topic concerns what our responsibility is for people less well of than us, what the best cause is, and what good career choices are. How much we ought to do for others?\n \n Climate change \n On what principles should nations agree on the extent of their emissions of greenhouse gasses? Should the nations that have contributed most to climate change compensate the nations that are suffering, and will suffer, most from it? Or should some other\nprinciple of justice govern the way we allocate quotas for greenhouse gas emissions?\n \n Animals \n It is common to draw a sharp line between how we are allowed to treat human beings and what we are allowed to do to animals. We consider cannibalism abhorrent, but routinely raise and kill animals for food. We set strict guidelines for experimenting on\nhuman beings, but much more lax ones for experimenting on animals. Is this attitude to animals justifiable? One way to put this question is to ask: 窶廛o animals have rights?窶� But the debate does not have to revolve around animal rights. It can also be\nput in terms of the idea of equality, and where it stops窶杯hat is, does equality only apply to human beings? This topic concerns how we should treat animals, and when experimentation on animals is justified.\n \n Environmental values \n It is one thing to argue that we can extend ethics beyond the boundary of our own species, to other sentient beings, but it is a quite different thing to hold that there is also intrinsic value in something that cannot feel anything, like plants, or isn窶冲\neven alive, like mountains and streams. Can such a claim be justified? If it cannot, what difference does it make to the case for wilderness protection?\n \n Why act ethically? Many of you might reach the conclusion that the ethical life can be a demanding one. So why bother? Why act ethically, rather than doing whatever you please? This is an ancient question, which some philosophers have dismissed\nas illegitimate, and others have sought to answer, in various ways. It leads us to questions about the meaning of life, and what it is to lead a good life.\n \n This course will introduce you to some of the ways philosophers have approached these questions, as well as some of their answers.

As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains.

Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems.

It provides both theoretical and practical perspectives on the nature of management in today窶冱 organisations.', 'Managing the Company of the Future provides\nyou with a comprehensive framework for understanding both the traditional principles of management inside companies today as well as the alternative\nprinciples that are becoming increasingly important. It therefore builds on the established\ntheories of work (e.g. those of Weber, McGregor, Drucker, Mintzberg), while\nalso providing you with a way of talking about the emerging theories of\nself-organising and crowdsourcing. It has a practical dimension as well, with a focus\non helping you understand how you can make small-scale changes within\nyour own work organisation today and in the future.\n By the end of the course, you will have gained theoretical and practical knowledge about the practice of management in contemporary organisations.

Critical thinking is a key skill in the information age, valuable in all disciplines and professions. This introductory course will give you the opportunity to better understand what critical thinking is, and to practice and enhance your critical thinking skills. To do so, we will use the context of some important global challenges that affect us all, and to which we have no clear 窶彡orrect窶� solutions: for example, the risk and spread of serious infectious diseases in epidemics in modern societies, the implications of increasing human population on global resources, energy, environment and climate, and the challenges of human health and wellbeing in the modern world.

At the same time writing efficient computer programs\n to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.\n Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve\n a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce\n parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.ﾂ�\n Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,\n computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.\n Although parallel computing will be covered, this is not a class\n on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days\n have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,\n the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,\n desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and\n students who don''t have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still\n be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.\n Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools\n such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control\n systems.

It covers main economic functions of government, including taxation, regulation, and social service delivery, and touches upon economic, social, political and administrative aspects of government窶冱 involvement in economy.', 'This course offers an introduction into the public economics theory. It does not aspire to cover theories of taxation, public expenditures, regulation etc. at length and in-depth. Rather, our ambition is to give a bird''s-eye view of central themes of public economics and related disciplines, and teach concepts, logic, and ideas, rather than methods of analysis, which would require an entirely different course format. Our choice of topics covered by the course reflects a trade-off between salience and centrality, on the one hand, and suitability for a brief online introductory course, on the other. The course content is neither comprehensive (which would be a "mission impossible" for virtually any public economics course"), nor representative of other such courses. With these limitations and caveats in mind, we encourage our students to continue their public economics studies in a more regular fashion, and see our role inter alia in motivating interest in such "continued education". The central theme of the course is the role of government as a mechanism of resource allocation which complements and augments markets. Governments are viewed as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two imperfect alternatives. We deal with government''s limitations, with particular emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative capacity, and imperfect accountability to society. Otherwise the course''s man themes are economics of taxation, regulation, politics of public economics, incentives in government, and government vis-ﾃ�-vis (civil) society.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/publiceconom', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRIJ9atB1A0', '2014-04-28', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/80/39a038465fe5a012e7a6f0a9dcbb50/Public-Economics.jpg', 'Econ & Fin', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Higher School of Economics', '2015-11-21 09:19:35'),

The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability 窶� a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.\n ﾂ�\n Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics 窶� at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box 窶� a valuable ability in today窶冱 world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.\n ﾂ� The course is offered in two versions. The eight-week-long Basic Course is designed for people who want to develop or improve mathematics-based, analytic thinking for professional or general life purposes. The ten-week-long Extended Course is aimed primarily atﾂ�first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. The final two weeks are more intensive and require more mathematical background than the Basic Course. There is no need to make a formal election between the two. Simply skip or drop out of the final two weeks if you decide you want to complete only the Basic Course.

This is preceded by a thorough analysis of 1D and 2D data.', 'This is an\nunconventional course in modern Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data\nMining. Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis\nshould help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented\nby the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this\nview, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and\naugmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.\nThe term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and\nmeans and more complex summaries: the principal\ncomponents of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.\nSimilarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between\ninput and target features including Bayes classifiers.\n\nThe view of the data as a subject of\ncomputational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.\nTypically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the\ninvestigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a\nsolution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with\nthe advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data\nset - what sense can be made out of it? 窶� Is there any structure in the data\nset? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a\ntraveler窶冱 view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientist\nsits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodate\nthem into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come on\ntheir way 窶� here is the data analysis niche.ﾂ�\nA textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published by\nSpringer-London in 2011: 窶廚ore\nconcepts in data analysis is clean and devoid\nof any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarity\nseldom seen in a text of this sophistication. 窶ｦ To single out just one of the\ntext窶冱 many successes: I doubt readers will ever encounter again such a detailed\nand excellent treatment of correlation concepts.

(669, 'Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society', 'Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.\n', 'This is a course aimed at making you a better designer. The course marries theory and practice, as both are valuable in improving design performance. Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity.\nWeekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis\nof the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior\nsessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also\nbe a peer reviewer. This format allows you to see an interesting collection of projects while getting useful feedback on your own project.\n \n Student Testimonials from Earlier Sessions of the Course:\n \n"An amazing course - a joy to take. I will really miss checking in every\n week to see the latest. I learned a great deal, from the videos, [the course staff] and my fellow\n students.

This course provides a basic introduction to the major macroeconomic issues. The first and somewhat bigger part of the course is dedicated to the description of the general equilibrium in the economy, including the labor market, market for loanable funds, financial market, money market, and the goods market, as well as international capital flows. This part also covers long-term growth, associated with accumulation of capital and technological progress. The second part of the course is dedicated to the analysis of the short-term fluctuations around the long-term growth trend, such as the world financial crisis and the global recession of 2008-2009.

(673, 'Unethical Decision Making in Organizations', 'This course ''Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark side of the force'' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.', 'This course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness. The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines. Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.

This course explains basic aspects of bluff body aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with application to sports and building aerodynamics. It is intended for anyone with a strong interest in these topics. Key fields addressed are urban physics, wind engineering and sports engineering. ', 'Can\nthe present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be\nfurther improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in\nathletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This\ncourse provides the answer to these questions. It shows that\naerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex\nand that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused\nby the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same\ncounter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both\nsports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will\nhelp you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes\nand of modern building design. In\n2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a\nTour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25\nkm, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the\nsubsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat\nthe former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic\nimprovements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And,\nsurprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team\ntime trial has not yet been explored. \nRecords\nin athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and\nthe long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International\nAssociation of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed\n2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail\nwinds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be\ndecisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum\naerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.\n \nNew\nand prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of\nthe world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy\nsystems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions\ncan lead to suboptimal performance. \n\n \nThe\ncourse starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of\nfluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary\nlayers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and\nbuilding aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the\naerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined.

The 21st\ncentury also opens up an ever-intensifying degree of social risks, relativity\nand uncertainty. ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ� It is against this general background\nthat the existing model of law and judiciary in China has been subject to\ncross-cutting pressures. A better analysis, understanding and reflection of the\ngeneral social milieu thus becomes a matter of necessity should law-makers,\nlaw-enforcers, judges, prosecutors and lawyers seek better solutions in\npractice. An pragmatic adjustment of legal institutions to contemporary needs,\nbe it by means of learning from other countries or of the trial-and-error\nprocess of innovation, will not be possible unless we are equipped with better\nsocial knowledge and greater familiarity with the history of thoughts. ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ�ﾂ� Needless to say, the Chinese society is a\nsuper-large-scale complex system, of which cross-cutting social networks play\nan ultimately important role of self-organisation. Here, individual or\ngroup-based ways of conduct and thinking are culturally distinctive, albeit\nwith consistent practical reason of universal implications 窶� a basis upon which\nthere arise such comparative-law prototypes as of the constitution of social\nnorms, the design of legal institutions, judiciary practice, the awareness of\nrights, justice-related social psychology, and the mechanism of ordering. With\na 窶徑aw and society窶� perspective, this module aims to put the Chinese social\nstructure and its function under microscopic observation through legal lens,\nwhile as its obverse, to interpret legal phenomena in the Chinese social\ncontext. In particular, daily routines, facts and concrete cases will be used\nto map the evolution of legal traditions, analyse the conditions for\nconstituting a rule-of-law order, and reveal the value implications on our\nnetworked and risk society of a new rule-of-law paradigm with 窶徘rinciples窶拿nembedded within rational actions. ﾂ�', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/sjtula014', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XdF49_BoF4', '2014-01-01', 11, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/78/f4d5696a89a8fb803583e03ffa2c55/____2.jpg', 'Law', 'Coursera', 0, 'Chinese (PRC)', 'yes', 'Shanghai Jiao Tong University', '2015-11-21 09:19:34'),

Broughton MBA It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly\nface. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms\ntrying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.\n \n Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why\nwe rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.\n \n Through this self-paced course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. In every module, you窶冤l learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations.\nArmed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it 窶� and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.

Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other Part.\n Part One focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions 窶聾ho rises to the top?窶� and 窶聾ho gets what?窶�.

Part Two turns to an arguably even more important question 窶聾ho are we?窶� as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction 窶� and their interaction with economic conditions and human values.

Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends窶� faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms. The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/images', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiBlKRtd1B0', '2016-01-04', 9, 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/images/large-icon.png', 'Math, ComSci: AI, Engi', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Duke University', '2015-11-21 09:19:35'),

Drawing on the latest archeological research and a wide range of comparative texts, this course synthesizes fascinating recent research in biblical studies and presents a powerful new thesis: Facing catastrophic defeat, the biblical authors created a new form of community窶背hat today we would call "peoplehood." Their achievements bear directly on modern questions of politics, economics, and theology.', 'With its walls razed to ground by Babylon窶冱 armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities窶杷rom Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.ﾂ� But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.ﾂ� The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope. ﾂ� ﾂ� Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity窶冱 greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors窶� visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:ﾂ� the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life. ﾂ� The objectives of the course are to show: 窶派ow biblical scholars work with archaeological and comparative texts to study the Bible''s formation; 窶派ow the Bible emerged from large-scale corporate crisis and rupture; 窶杯hat in our present state of uncertainty and instability we have much to learn from the various strategies the biblical authors adopted to create an enduring 窶徘eople of the book窶�; 窶杯hat one doesn窶冲 have to believe in God or accept the historicity of the Bible in order to appreciate its profound political messages; 窶杯hat the Bible offers modern societies a model for creating communities around a shared collection of texts, songs, and laws; 窶蚤nd that the Bible itself has a major role to play in our futures.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/biblefuture', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ntJ-wF2pE8', '2014-05-26', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/b1c0ccbfc15fb49e3719618b36929f/wright-class.jpg', 'SocSci, Humanities', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Emory University', '2015-11-21 09:19:33'),

We tend to makeﾂ�everyday economic decisions 窶� what to buy, what job to choose, how to save one''s income 窶� without complicated calculations, instead relying on common sense.\nUnfortunately, common sense does not always appear to be enlightened and\ntrained enough.\n\n Economic conceptions, with which we think, were shaped\nin different epochs and often bear not that very sense we tend to put into\nthem. We sometimes accumulate money in a way our predecessors did, although at\nthat time it was gold or silver, while now we deal with just paper. We easily\nrefer to GDP, being hardly aware of complexities behind this notion. We believe\nto politicians promising to make our life wealthy and happy, not distinguishing\nreliable promises from those just fooling us.ﾂ�\n\n History of economic thought is a distillation of experiences in solving complicated\nproblems of economic life 窶� experiences that were shaped in struggle of ideas\nwith conflicting social interests behind them. In our course we summarize\nlessons of outstanding economic thinkers, such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx,\nLeon Walras and Joseph Schumpeter, Torstein Veblen and Nikolai Kondratieff,\nJohn M. Keynes and others. We shall analyze how responding to the challenges of\ntheir times they created the corps of our economic knowledge with its powers\nand limitations.

How are some genes activated\nand others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics. ﾂ�\n\n Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research\nover the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control\ncontributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable\nthrough cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to\nmutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,\nepigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be\nmanipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that\nepigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),\nwhich has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\n This course will give an introduction to the\nfundamentals of epigenetic control.

In this subject, we will examine the major theories used by macro economists to analyse national economies and the international economy. ', 'In this course,\nwe will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide\neconomists窶� and policy makers窶� understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics\nis a word derived from the Greek prefix 窶徇akros窶�, meaning large. It is the study\nof economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the\neconomic management role played by governments and international organisations.\n\n\n The founder of\nmodern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote\n窶弋he ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right\nand when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,\nthe world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be\nquite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some\ndefunct economist.窶� This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the\ninfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,\nunemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.\n\n We will cover\nimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment\nand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid\nthe foundation for governments窶� active management of the macroeconomy in the\npost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal\npolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.ﾂ� Economists窶� approaches to the analysis of\nlong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be\ncritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate\nand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not\nshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic\ntheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach\ntheir task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed\nanalysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy\ndebates.

S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create social change. We will introduce you to S-ENT examples and guide you through the process of identifying an opportunity to address social problems as well as outlining your idea in a business plan.', 'In this course we will ask you to form groups with other MOOC participants to identify an opportunity to create social change, develop a business model, and outline ideas in a business plan, which you will in the end submit to possibly receive start-up funding. The domain of social change is no longer reserved for students of political sciences and development studies. Increasingly business graduates are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality. A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made. As part of the course you will be working in groups on identifying an opportunity for a social innovation or social enterprise.

', 'We develop throughout life. Those of us who are able to\ncontinuously develop toward sustained, desired change do so, in part, with the\nhelp of others. This form of helping is called coaching. The result of\neffective coaching is that a person feels excited, motivated and inspired to\nlearn, change and try new things in life. Although not required, this course\nbuilds on concepts introduced in the MOOC entitled Inspiring Leadership through\nEmotional Intelligence.\n\n Effective\ncoaching should result in a combination of three changes: (1) the person being\ncoached finds, articulates or reaffirms his or her personal vision, that is\ntheir dreams and passion; (2) the person changes their behavior, thoughts or\nfeelings to move closer to their personal vision; and/or (3) the person builds\nor maintains a resonant relationship with one or more people. We call this the\nPositive (PEA) and Negative Emotional Attractors (NEA) through Intentional\nChange Theory. Most efforts at trying to help or motivate others are what we\ncall 窶彡oaching for compliance,窶� whether by managers, teachers, doctors, or\nparents. In this approach, the person is brought into the negative emotional\nattractor by someone trying to fix them or tell them how to change. An alternative\nis what we call 窶彡oaching with compassion窶� in which the person is brought into\nthe positive emotional attractor by initially discussing their dreams, values,\nand invoking hope, mindfulness, compassion and even playfulness.\n\n Based on decades of our longitudinal\nand neuroscience research into coaching, the course will examine the theory,\nresearch, as well as techniques and skills in effective coaching (i.e.,\ncoaching with compassion). We will explore the building of a coaching\nrelationship, the ethics of helping others. \n\n The\ncourse will consist of five weeks, with three modules per week.

In this course we\nwill examine possible alternatives for these fuels - which have proved quite\ndamaging to both our health and our environment. We will describe the intensive\nworldwide efforts in this field of research, and present their encouraging\noutcome: a range of innovative technologies for generating clean energy from\nnatural, non-polluting and renewable sources 窶� such as sunlight, wind\nand water. The\ncourse will open with some fundamental questions on energy: What are the energy\nneeds of the global population today, and what will they be tomorrow? What are\nthe resources at our disposal? What are the known processes for harvesting,\nconverting and utilizing resources of energy? What are the problems generated by\nthe use of fossil fuels? In what ways must we change our energy policies and\nenergy economy? And most important of all: What are the alternatives to fossil\nfuels, and can they supply humanity''s extensive and constantly growing energy\nneeds? Subsequent\nlessons will introduce the main types of safe, clean, natural and renewable\nenergy sources available to us: solar energy, wind energy, water energy and\nbioenergy. We will speak of existing technologies that already harness these\nresources to the needs of humankind, and supply simple tools for computing\nconversion efficiencies, calculating the amounts of energy produced through the\nvarious methods, and assessing their economic feasibility. In parallel,\nwe will discuss the remaining problems and challenges, and ask what must\nbe done to enable the large-scale use of renewable energy 窶� in industry, in\ntransportation, and in every other sphere of our lives.

However, despite the rhetoric, in many sites and many ways education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better?

This introductory course explores main and most connected with everyday life topics of economics. Two parts of economics are micro-and macroeconomics. Microeconomics studies the behavior of smallest parts of national economy, first of all consumers and producers, their choices and interaction. In Microeconomics we deal with demand and supply; production, costs and profits; competition, monopoly and oligopoly. Macroeconomics studies the national economy as a whole and deals with GDP, inflation, unemployment; economic growth and business cycle; fiscal and monetary policy.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/ecnonec', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64ae9df0582f11e4be058bbb0d76dc0d', '2015-01-26', 10, 'https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/e0/f93fe05dc111e4a260b1819267cd7d/ecnonec.png', 'Econ & Fin', 'Coursera', 0, 'Russian', 'yes', 'Higher School of Economics', '2015-11-21 09:19:36');

Small children tend toﾂ�shed tears in the hope that their parents will buy them a sweet they窶囘 like to try. Making a decision on whether to cry, a child takes the risk 窶� he can窶冲 know for sure what his mum and dad will do next. At a more mature age, students make a hard decision as to which university to apply to. A mistake can be costly: a student who happened to choose the wrong strategy may find himself studying at a second-rate university or not even enter university at all. After graduating from university, young men and women start looking for a job. Before a job interview, they look through different articles on the Internet on what they should and shouldn窶冲 say during theﾂ�interview. They try to find the best strategy of how to behave based on the expectations of the company they strive to get a job in. All of these situations have something in common: decisions made by some people influence what other people do. We call these situations strategic interactions, and we will use the term 窶枠ame窶� toﾂ�refer to any of them. Such games are exactly what game theory studies (although games, as ordinarily understood, usually turn out to be strategic interactions as well).\n\n In order to analyse a real-life situation of strategic interaction and find an optimal way of behaviour, we should do two things. First, we need to formalise this situation using the language of game theory, i.e. to create a model (game). Second, when the model (game) is created, we need to solve it.

The course objectives are: to reveal the distinguishing features of the philosophy of culture as an explanatory model; to consider the formation of philosophic discourse in culture over the period of time; to teach students to discern the layered patterns in the empirical material of cultures and to bring heterogenous cultural components to a common denominator to create the generalization prompting further theoretical modelling. It also provides the students with the general understanding of the historical development of the theory of culture from antiquity to the present days. The course focuses on the morphology of various types of culture. Emphasis is made on the Western European culture of the Modern Times. The underlying theme of the course is: 窶徂ow is theoretical knowledge of culture possible?窶� As a result, a student will be aware of the core patterns in history of the philosophy of culture, their features, and the logic of their construction; will be able to employ the basic methods of philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena; will become acquainted with the basic epistemological problems and paradoxes associated with the experience of constructing a theory of culture.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/philculture', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e56b7d0585f11e4907329a9ab6526e6', '2014-11-24', 8, 'https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/55/dddac05e8d11e487da13d17b09f3e9/philculture1.png', 'Humanities', 'Coursera', 0, 'Russian', 'yes', 'Higher School of Economics', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

The project will include the following outputs: \n \n Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.\n Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.\n Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.\n Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.\n\n\n From the perspective of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. \n\n By working on these tasks, you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the Capstone. \n\n You are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading.

Why do some struggle\nacademically while others excel at school despite minimal study? Why do some\nsuffer the ravages of a psychotic illness like schizophrenia while others enjoy\na life free of mental illness? At the core to answering these questions is the\nages-old "nature-nurture" debate: Are the behavioral differences\namong us due predominantly to inborn natural differences or the cumulative\nimpact of our experiences?

Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic andﾂ�environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning. This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological).

The course will introduce a broad audience of learners to Shakespeare, as we collectively read, watch, and engage four Shakespeare plays: Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night窶冱 Dream,ﾂ�Much Ado About Nothing,ﾂ�and The Tempest. Shakespeare窶冱 Hamlet begins with the curious and provocative line, 窶弩ho窶冱 there?,窶� and these are the words that will begin our course. The line is both a literal question to the audience and a deeper question about what it means to be human. The question takes on a different set of potential meanings when it is read on the screen of a computer, iPad, smart phone, or within a MOOC, asking contemporary readers of Shakespeare to consider how their humanity is changing in the face of rapid technological changes. The goal of thisﾂ�Shakespeare in Communityﾂ�course,ﾂ�then, will be to discover Shakespeare while also considering together what it is for us to discover and un-cover Shakespeare in the digital age. Ultimately, this course will be focused on building a global community around the study of Shakespeare. And so one of our central goals will be to use Shakespeare窶冱 plays as an occasion for creating important conversations that bridge cultures, languages, and geographies. Students in the course will also increase their digital literacies, learning new tools for reading, writing, critical analysis, and collaboration. The course will be both about Shakespeare and also about the digital humanities, encouraging learners to think critically about how digital tools (including MOOCs) can be used to investigate literary texts. While the primary instructors have 60+ years of experience teaching Shakespeare among us, we will not be serving as talking head 窶彳xperts窶� in this course. Rather, the course will bring together a broad range of experts at UW-Madison, within the Madison theater communities, from the Folger Shakespeare Library, and around the world. Launching each week of the course will be a series of short documentaries, but the heart of the course will be the community we build among the participants. Our goal is not to teach you what we know about Shakespeare, but to help each of you find your Shakespeare.

We will consider important software vulnerabilities and attacks that exploit them -- such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and session hijacking -- and we will consider defenses that prevent or mitigate these attacks, including advanced testing and program analysis techniques. Importantly, we take a "build security in" mentality, considering techniques at each phase of the development cycle that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems.', 'Software is everywhere: in laptops and desktops, mobile phones, the power grid ... even our cars and thermostats. Software is increasingly the vehicle that drives our economy and our personal lives. But software窶冱 pervasiveness, and its importance, make it a target: at the root of many security compromises is vulnerable software. In this course we will look at how to build software that is secure. To start, we must know what we are up against. As such, we will examine the most prevalent software design and implementation defects.ﾂ� We will examine vulnerabilities like buffer overruns and use-after-frees that are present in programs written in low-level programming languages like C and C++, and see how these vulnerabilities can be exploited by a clever attacker. We will also look attacks on applications that are part of the worldwide web -- attacks with names like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking. We will also mention side-channel attacks (such as those based on the size of messages or the time taken to process a request), attacks on the human user (like phishing), and failures of design (like the use of insecure defaults). Examples of these attacks will be taken from the headlines. Having examined these defects and their role in security compromises, we will look at how to prevent them entirely, or mitigate their effects, by improving the software''s design and implementation. We will see that security must appear at all phases in the development lifecycle, including requirements development, system design, implementation, and testing/validation. Finally, we will look at state-of-the-art tools and techniques for testing and otherwise verifying that software is secure. We will consider how security testing differs from functional testing (it''s harder!). We will look at the art of penetration testing, which is the activity of trying to find and exploit weaknesses in a system prior to its deployment. We will also look at an emerging class of program analysis tools that can automatically identify flaws in programs by analyzing their code. At the conclusion of the course, the student will know how to "build security in" rather than consider it as an afterthought, and will have a plethora of skills, applicable at each phase of the development cycle, that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/softwaresec', 'N/A', '2015-11-09', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/14/abbf60e67c11e391bedd928f66fcc0/CYBER_hicks.jpg', 'ComSci: Systems & Security', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of Maryland, College Park', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

In this course, we will study security and trust from the hardware perspective. We will start with a short survey of the roles of hardware in security and trust. With all types of dedicated hardware/circuits, known as co-processors, being developed to speed up application specific computations, hardware窶冱 role changes from the enabler to an enhancer. Nowadays, hardware becomes the enforcer for secure systems because it is used to ensure that only the authenticated user and software can access the processor. However, current hardware design flow does not have security as a key design objective. Consequently, we will conduct several case studies where hardware turns into the weakest link in secure systems. Then we will review the fundamentals of digital logic design and use this as an example to analyze the source of security vulnerabilities and demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can become legitimate security threats. We conclude with the basic principles and practical methods of design for security and trust, as well as a study of the associated design cost. ﾂ� Next, we introduce physical attacks to popular digital systems such as smart cards and FPGA-based systems. We will focus on side-channel attacks, which have been demonstrated many times to be able to successfully reveal the secret cryptographic keys stored in the secure systems. These attacks include power analysis, timing attacks, and electromagnetic attacks. Standard countermeasures to these attacks will also be introduced. Finally we will learn the new hardware security primitives that can help us to build secure systems. We will see how the trust platform module (TPM) works; what is a silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) and why it is useful for system security; what is a hardware Trojan horse and the security threats it brings to the system; why counterfeiting becomes a serious problem for hardware design intellectual property protection. Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems.

You will learn the theory behind methods for building and analyzing phylogenetic trees, and get hands-on experience with some widely used software packages.\n', 'This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.ﾂ� A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (e.g., neighbor joining).ﾂ� Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are ﾂ�investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree will be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.ﾂ� Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology). Topics covered: Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics. Mechanisms of molecular evolution. Models of substitution. Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques.

Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul.

How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ?

To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison?ﾂ� For the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade..... Classic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.

Issues\nin traditionally non health sectors such as climate change or trade\ncan have dramatic and worldwide effects on health and health systems.\n \n These short examples illustrate what Global Health is about:ﾂ� issues\nthat not only cross national boundaries but also disciplinary territories.\nIn our interdependent world, more and more health issues cannot be addressed\nby a country nor by a sector alone and require collaboration, coordination\nand integration.\n The course will draw from academic personnel working across disciplines and the \nwider community in international Geneva (e.g. international \norganisations, NGOs).

Intended Audience This course will offer a practical approach to prescribing antibiotic therapy and development of antimicrobial stewardship to physicians and pharmacists across all specialties and settings. Course Description Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence 窶� inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This course will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage the learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. Learning Objectives Develop skills to apply IDSA guidelines in treating common infections such as acute rhino-sinusitis. Apply evidence based antibiotic management to treat sepsis. Implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship when providing care to special populations and in various settings. Apply evidence based antibiotic management to surgical patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. Apply evidence based antibiotic stewardship program in the outpatient setting.Accreditation Statement The Stanford University School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance\nwas increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed\nimmediate questions of decorative languageﾂ�\n(antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of\nconceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic\nstructural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first,\nthe new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system,\nand only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural\nconceptions that descended from Florentine exempla.

We will start with the fundamental concept of one-dimensional cases, understand the essentials, and also cover extended topics.', 'This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. It starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibrations can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. The essential measures for acoustic waves, such as dB scale, octave scale, acoustic pressure, energy, intensity, will also be explained. These measures are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide clear and simple physical insights. The course then moves on to explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.ﾂ�Subsequent topics are radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space. In Part 1, we will handle topics from vibrations and waves to waves on a flat surface of discontinuity. The laterﾂ�parts will beﾂ�covered in Part 2.

Why should we have a State? What kind of State should we have? Even within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government. Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty. Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny. In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements. All political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas. In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change. We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world窶冱 most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers and contemporary theorists.

The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.', 'The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed, although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.ﾂ� The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs): elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next (unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.ﾂ�', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/finiteelementmethods', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a0406101e9b11e5a0b6c312153fa7b6', '2015-10-05', 15, 'https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/fe/e79870477311e5bbfd7500a1824fa5/finiteelement.png', 'Math, Physics, Engi', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of Michigan', '2015-11-21 09:19:35'),

It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data\nanalysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process\nmining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g.,\nsimulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric\nanalysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining\nseeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and\nprocess models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has\nbecome available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational\nprocesses (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing\ntreatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a\nmultinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using a booking\nsite, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user\ninterface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that\ndynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this\nas "data science in action".\n\n The course explains the key analysis\ntechniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery\nalgorithms.

The topics in this course are timely since the advent of multi-core and distributed-core processors--coupled with ubiquitous wireless and wireline connectivity--is increasing the demand for researchers and practitioners who understand how to successfully develop and deploy concurrent and networked software. Despite continuous improvements in processors and networks during the past four decades, however, developing quality concurrent and networked software remains hard; developing qualityﾂ�reusableﾂ�concurrent and networked software is even harder. The principles, methods, and skills required to develop such software can be greatly enhanced by understanding how to create and apply patterns and frameworks. Aﾂ�patternﾂ�describes a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form aﾂ�pattern languageﾂ�that provides a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. Aﾂ�frameworkﾂ�is an integrated set of software components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related applications. Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of design and code. This course describes how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate many accidental and inherent complexities associated with developing and deploying concurrent and networked software. These patterns and frameworks have been used successfully in many domains, including telecom/datacom, mobile devices, electronic medical imaging, network management, aerospace, avionics, automation, online gaming, and financial systems. Over the coming weeks and months I''ll illustrate by example how patterns and frameworks simplify and enhance the development of concurrent and networked software via the use of: Object-oriented design concepts and notations -- such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, extensibility, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Object-oriented programming language features -- such as classes, inheritance, dynamic binding, and parameterized types available in languages like Java, C++, and C#. Middleware -- which is infrastructure software residing between applications and the underlying operating systems, networks, and hardware that encapsulates heterogeneity and enables control over key end-to-end quality-of-service properties, such as dependability and security. Operating system mechanisms -- such as event demultiplexing, multi-threading, multi-processing, and dynamic linking.

Intended Audience This course is designed to meet the educational needs of a national audience of physicians and allied health professionals who specialize in family practice, primary care, internal medicine and oncology. Course Description Racial and ethnic diversity is critical to the success of cancer clinical trials. Asian Americans, like other ethnic groups, have low recruitment, accrual and retention rates in cancer clinical trials. This represents a significant challenge on a national level for health advocates, healthcare institutions and the National Cancer Institute. To improve communication and awareness of clinical trials for Asian American patients, it is important to increase learners窶� knowledge about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility. This online course will educate healthcare providers and allied health professionals about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility skills as well as provide educational resources and tips for reinforcing change in practice to improve outcomes in Asian American clinical trial participation. Learning Objectives Develop strategies to determine appropriate patients for clinical trials. Apply cultural humility skills to effectively communicate with Asian American patients about cancer clinical trials. Identify at least 5 ways that will reinforce change in practice to incorporate clinical trials education and referral among Asian American patients and apply it in practice. Recognize how to access at least 5 cancer clinical trial resources and use them in education and referral.Disclosures The following planner and speaker indicated that he has relevant financial relationships with industry to disclose relative to the content of this activity: Contracted Research for clinical trials with Genentech, Novartis, Bristol, Ipsen, Tercica, Gilead and Newlink George Fisher, MD.

These perturbations are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology.

From the saved memories of Catholic churchmen, Jewish noble and\nmerchant families, as well as medieval lords and knight clans, students will\nstudy and contribute to an effort to revive long lost interactive and\ncooperative networks of people in Plasencia, Spain. And among the most textured, fascinating elements of our investigation is the history of Spain''s Jewish community, or the Sepharad.\n\n For example, students will evaluate the Spanish\nanti-Jewish pogroms of 1391 that led\nto the large scale conversion of Jews to Christianity (forced and voluntary). By\ndocumenting such incidents and the interaction of noteworthy families,\nreligious organizations, political networks, and economic partnerships, we will\nreconstruct the quintessential cultural dynamics that underlay the foundation\nof the Castilian world and impacted the broader European continent.

The course will focus on helping teachers to offer emotionally supportive interactions to the children in their care.', 'When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day\n that makes a difference in children窶冱 lives, there窶冱 clear evidence that\n it窶冱 the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most\n important.ﾂ� And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions\n that lead to children窶冱 development and learning.ﾂ� So this course\n focuses on those interactions.ﾂ� By the end of the course, you should\n have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that\n foster learning and development among your students. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Although there are many types of interactions that are critical to\nyoung children窶冱 development, this course will focus on one area in particular\n窶� Emotional Support. \n\n This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the\nfoundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are\nEmotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and\nexcited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know\nthat, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood\n teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge 窶� knowledge about children窶冱\n development, about the content they窶决e teaching, about effective teaching\n practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms,\n and about themselves. In this course we窶冤l focus a bit on knowledge about\n children窶冱 development and we窶冤l spend lots of time focused on knowledge\n about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and\n development.\n Another part of effective teaching is seeing. All the knowledge\n in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good\n teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like 窶� in lots of different\n types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers\n tell us they don窶冲 get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers\n teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get\n them. We窶冤l spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom\n videos and we窶冤l also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.\n Ultimately we can窶冲 learn to be an effective teacher without practice\n 窶� we need to spend some time doing 窶� enacting the teaching practices\n that we窶冤l learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really\n learn about them 窶� you need to spend some time practicing the types of\n interactions we窶冤l be talking about.\n There窶冱 one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effectiveﾂ�\n teachers spend time reflecting on their practice. We think of this\n a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying\n glass 窶� we窶冤l give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have\n learned throughout this course.\n Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget\n Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom\n Assessment Scoring System 窶� or CLASS(邃｢). CLASS is an observational measure\n used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective\n teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching\n practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe\n and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to\n increase the effectiveness of teachers'' interactions with young children.ﾂ�ﾂ�\n \n \n *********************************************************************\n \n \n \n\n The development of the course was funded, in part, by the\nInstitute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant\nR305A100154-11 to the University of Virginia.ﾂ�\nThe opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent\nviews of the U.S. Department of Education.ﾂ�', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/earlychildhood', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCVbqqK1e2w', '2013-10-22', 4, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f9/7f1fa1c3c1fbd112025399193ce912/CourseLogo.jpg', 'Education, Teach', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of Virginia', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

The evidence will be drawn from neuroscience, psychology, science history and philosophy.

In the 1960s and for the following few decades, it seemed all but certain that the rapidly growing body of information about the electrophysiological and anatomical properties of neurons in the primary visual pathway of experimental animals would reveal how the brain uses retinal stimuli to generate perceptions and appropriate visually guided behaviors. But despite the passage of more than fifty years, this expectation has not been met. In retrospect, the missing piece is understanding how stimuli that cannot specify the properties of physical sources can nevertheless give rise to perceptions and behaviors that are routinely successful. Most concepts of vision propose, explicitly or implicitly, that successful visual behavior depends on recovering the sources of stimulus features either directly or by a process of statistical inference. However, given the inability of the visual system to access the physical properties of the world, these conceptual frameworks cannot account for the behavioral success of biological vision. The alternative is that the visual system automatically links simple, recurrent stimulus patterns with reproductive success, without ever recovering real world properties. This strategy provides a different way of studying the relationship between the objective world and subjective experience, and offers a way of understanding the operating principles of visual circuitry without invoking feature detection, image representation in the brain, and/or probabilistic inference.

This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27窶� LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain.ﾂ� For the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it!ﾂ� In this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on.

Part One explores the economics of payment systems and money markets. Part Two explores connections with foreign exchange and capital markets.', 'The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant. Three features of the new system are central. Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see.

Part One explores the economics of payment systems and money markets. Part Two explores connections with foreign exchange and capital markets.  NOTE:  The first week of Part Two reviews Part One, so you can take Part Two even if you missed Part One.', 'This is Part Two of a two-part course; you can find Part One here.ﾂ� The description below pertains to the course as a whole, both parts. The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant. Three features of the new system are central. Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse. ﾂ� Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective. ﾂ�Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.ﾂ� Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That''s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/money2', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_oAv3k-2LQ', '2015-07-05', 7, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/63/bece9dad904bb5aa16ac3e511f5fb2/institute_pgm_1_600x340.jpg', 'Econ & Fin', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Columbia University', '2015-11-21 09:19:35'),

We therefore followed the development of the Hebrew literary community until the Second World War, extending over three continents.

In order to study the behavior of such functions we窶冤l need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We窶冤l begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons? Once we窶况e answered these questions we窶冤l devote some time to learn about basic properties of complex numbers that will make it possible for us to use them in more advanced settings later on. We will learn how to do basic algebra with these numbers, how they behave in limiting processes, etc. These facts enable us to begin the study of complex functions, and at this point we can already understand the basics about the construction of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets (if you have never heard of \nthese that窶冱 quite alright, but do look at \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set for example to see some \nbeautiful pictures). When studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation 窶� a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. Don窶冲 worry! We窶冤l help you remember facts from calculus in case you have forgotten.ﾂ� After this exploration we will be ready to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places, a fact which endows these functions with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We窶冤l explore these properties! Who would want to differentiate without being able to undo it? Clearly we窶冤l have to learn about integration as well.

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals.', 'MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences through all disciplines of engineering to finance and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today窶冱 job market. Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial.

In the second chapter, hidden DNA messages tell us how organisms know whether it is day or night as well as how the bacterium causing tuberculosis is able to hide from antibiotics.

Later in the course, we will see that sequencing genomes is not the only task related to decoding biological macromolecules.ﾂ� Another difficult problem is sequencing antibiotics, short mini-proteins engineered by bacteria to fight each other.ﾂ� Even though antibiotics often contain fewer than 10 amino acids, sequencing them is a formidable challenge.ﾂ�Decoding the sequence of amino acids making up an antibiotic is an important biomedical problem, but the practical barriers to sequencing short antibiotics are often more substantial than barriers to assembling a genome with millions ofﾂ� nucleotides!

We will see that dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic tool when we compare two genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or two proteins. When we "zoom out" to compare entire genomes, we will employ combinatorial algorithms.', 'DNA mutations can broadly be divided into two categories. Point mutations, in which a single nucleotide (A, C, G, T) is altered, inserted, or deleted, are comparable to erosion slowly changing the shape of a boulder. Much of human differentiation is attributable to the accumulation of point mutations. The other type of mutation is extremely rare and can cause dramatic effects on the scale of species evolution. ﾂ�In genome rearrangements, huge blocks of DNA are heaved around, often from one chromosome to another. These mutations are comparable to earthquakes, which hoist up mountains and wrench apart continents. When we compare two relatively short pieces of DNA that have not been affected by genome rearrangements (say, two genes taken from individuals from the same species), our goal is to identify a "path of least resistance" connecting these two genes via point mutations. ﾂ�We can find such a path using a powerful algorithmic paradigm called dynamic programming. On the other hand, when we zoom out to the compare entire genomes taken from different species that diverged millions of years ago (such as humans and mice), the effects of genome rearrangements become more pronounced. To determine how far diverged these genomes are, we will need completely different combinatorial algorithmsﾂ�that will help us answerﾂ�questions about the patterns of genome rearrangements. For example, in order to move around large blocks of DNA, a genome rearrangement must "break" the genome in at least two places. We know that there are fault lines on the earth''s surface where earthquakes are more likely; are there analogous "fragile regions" in the human genome where breakage has been more likely to occur during a genome rearrangement?', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/comparinggenomes', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88e8d100423411e5ae2be938c8aa3f5a', '2016-01-04', 5, 'https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/cb/e5fe00b3ce11e4b6064da9c0aa77a1/chapter5_final-copy.jpg', 'Math, Bio & Life Sci, ComSci: Theory, ComSci: SE', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of California, San Diego', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

Estimated workload: 3-5 hrs/wk for non-credit; 7-10 hrs/wk for credit.', 'Video games are a globally entrenched entertainment medium that entertains, informs and challenges us. These games are defined by, and define our modern culture. In this course, students will learn how to study games and engage in informed discussions about them. Ultimately, this course is about understanding the literacy of video games. Understanding Video Games was created with the help of worldﾂ�renowned video game developer,ﾂ�BioWareﾂ�Corp, located in Edmonton, Alberta. The three main parts of the course are: 1) developing the terminology that enables us to talk about video games; 2) exploring how these terms are used in theoretical frameworks to interpret games, and; 3) turning these theories toward cultural aspects of games in order to understand how the medium has impacted society. One of the most important insights students will gain from the course will be an understanding of the interplay between video game designers, players and the games themselves. Course material is delivered in a student-friendly short-form fashion, with numerous formative feedback sections. Students will gain access to a number of special interactive modules designed specifically for this course. These modules will give users the opportunity to design their own video game avatar, as well as explore the short but fascinating history of video game releases. This course''s unique lesson delivery, combined with classic quiz structure, will enable students to quickly gain a solid foundational understanding of video games within the context of modern culture.ﾂ� UAlberta students can earn course credit: Learn how.

Humanitarianism, in all its\nvarious forms, is one response. In\nattempting to organise a humanitarian intervention, though, we are confronted\nby a wide range of problems. Most acute of these is the intense inequality\nwhich marks the contemporary world. Public health 窶� its capacities, delivery\nstructures and finances 窶� is profoundly different for the 1 billion people who\nlive in the world窶冱 wealthier countries.

Here, public pressure and the ethical imperative to bear witness when\nconfronted withﾂ�suffering are especially important.

Do those that can\nafford it have a responsibility to act in some way? What does receipt\nof aid mean for the recipient country, its leadership, its future, and its\nresponsibility? Must people be\nhelped only according to need, regardless of what a regime might have done? Must humanitarians\nremain neutral 窶� silent perhaps 窶� in the face of injustice in order to ensure\naccess?

(1258, 'Practicing Tolerance in a Religious Society: The Church and the Jews in Italy', 'What social and ideological mechanisms allowed Jews to survive and even flourish in Catholic Italy? And under what circumstances did the practice of tolerance break down? This course takes a different approach to the idea of tolerance, as well as to the long, complicated history of the Catholic Church and the Jews.', 'Discussions of the centuries-long relationship between Christianity and the Jews are almost always framed in terms of persecution and discrimination with only occasional examples of toleration and kindness. To explain or to excuse the ongoing hatred towards Jews, historians mix together terminologies and concepts drawn from religious theology, psychology, social theory and politics. The catch-all term "anti-Semitism" lumps together outbreaks of prejudice and victimization in different times and places. In this course, we shall ask a different question. Our focus is not on why a majority society saw Jews as different or reacted with violence to Jews'' "otherness." Rather, we ask how in a society dedicated to religious uniformity one group of people was tolerated even though it refused to join the dominant faith. Many modern writers assume that Christianity, and perhaps religion itself, is inherently intolerant of non-believers. But we will see that neither religious nor secular world views necessarily lead to toleration or discrimination. The patterns of Christian-Jewish relations are both complex and intriguing. Our question then is how did a religious society manage to practice tolerance, and under what circumstances did that practice break down? We will focus on the history of Jews in Italy and especially Rome, the city that housed the the longest continuous Jewish settlement in world history and that was also, for most of the past two millennia, the home of the Catholic Church.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/religionandtolerance', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1QyhcP1Wro', '2014-10-06', 6, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a8/93b5eb4345cfdda6ad00bc41fce981/1024px-Francois_Dubois_001.jpg', 'SocSci, Humanities', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of Maryland, College Park', '2015-11-21 09:19:34'),

In this course we will\nargue that globalization, even as we understand it today, in fact goes back at\nleast to the mid- to late 19th century when the existence of colonial empires\ncreated the conditions for mass migration, the rapid transportation of goods and\npeople, the invention of new technologies such as steam shipping, railways and\ntelegraphy, which all helped to facilitate the spread of theatre.

It is meant as a thorough but accessible introduction to the topics of descriptive statistics, probability theory, and statistical inference with hands-on exercises.', 'Statistics is the lingua franca of modern science, including the social sciences. It is also of ever greater importance in daily life, as data of all sorts are now ubiquitous. Statistical literacy is hence of great value, both for academic purposes and for our daily routines. This course offers a solid foundation in statistical reasoning and its uses in the quantitative social sciences. Learning statistics can be a daunting experience. There is a plethora of statistical concepts to master and many of them come with a hefty dose of mathematical notation. The goal of the present course is to develop a clear path through the conceptual forest and to explain each concept both in its narrow meaning and as a part of the larger enterprise of statistical reasoning. Mathematical skills are not taken for granted; instead, we shall review the necessary mathematical tools so that you will not get stuck on this aspect. The field of statistics is sometimes divided into descriptive and inferential statistics, with probability theory forming a bridge between the two. In this course, we start out descriptively, by considering different ways in which we can learn from data. We then delve into the subject of probability theory, to end with a discussion of statistical inference. The emphasis in this part is on learning how to draw conclusions about populations with the help of data from a sample. By the end of this course, you should have a good feeling for descriptive statistics, statistical inference, and probability theory.

In addition, the course includes content which introduces students to career opportunities in financial planning.', 'Financial Planning for Young Adults (FPYA), developed in partnership with the CFP Board, is designed to provide an introduction to basic financial planning concepts for young adults. The FPYA course is organized across seven separate modules, which are intended to be completed at a rate of approximately one week per module. Topics covered include financial goal setting, saving and investing, budgeting, financial risk, borrowing and credit. Because financial planning is such a personal topic, you will be encouraged to define your own financial goals and objectives while we discuss concepts and provide tools which can be applied in helping you reach those goals. \n\n Within each module, you will view a combination of traditional lecture style videos along with video vignettes that introduce financial topics for discussion among participants. The video vignettes provide a unique and exciting component to this course. Each vignette introduces a real-world scenario where financial decisions must be made and financial planning concepts can be applied. You will be challenged to think critically about each scenario and decide how you might come to a resolution if ever faced with a similar situation.\n\n Finally, the course also includes material throughout which is focused on career opportunities in financial planning, including video interviews with actual CFPﾂｮ professionals and other professionals working in this exciting and growing career area.

(1287, 'Dairy Production and Management', 'With the world''s first MOOOOO-C, you will gain a broad and comprehensive understanding of all aspects of dairy management such as genetics, nutrition, reproduction, animal health, farm economics, and sustainability of dairy production systems. There''s something here for everyone whether you are just looking for the basics or have years of experience in the dairy industry.', 'Why is producing milk efficiently and sustainably so important? Milk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs? Most milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population. In this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/dairy', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=746e6350355211e598968b839bc3d973', '2016-03-07', 8, 'https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/41/b66c603ac911e5ab7313930cc3266f/course_image.jpg', 'Bio & Life Sci, Nutrit', 'Coursera', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'The Pennsylvania State University', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

This course was first offered at Peking University in 2008 as a Public Elective Course, and subsequently as a Course for General Education. It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University窶冱 MOOCs.ﾂ� Addressing students'' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students窶� understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students窶� horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/20cnwm', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d34d93a0156e11e4b2110d23aaf1cb58', '2014-09-15', 12, 'https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/38/9dfbd0156711e4a6dbdbc226e96545/20______.jpg', 'Humanities , Arts, Music', 'Coursera', 0, 'Chinese (PRC)', 'yes', 'Peking University', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),

Model systems after human organizations or inter-human communication.', 'This is a follow-on for the Coursera class 窶弃rinciples of Functional Programming in Scala窶�, which so far had more than 100窶�000 inscriptions over two iterations of the course, with some of the highest completion rates of any massive open online course worldwide. The aim of the second course is to teach the principles of reactive programming. Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed stateﾂ�by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors. In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of message-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them.

We will then use methods from computational proteomics to test whether we can reconstruct Tyrannosaurus rex proteins and prove that birds evolved from dinosaurs.', 'In 2003, the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus caused panic as it swept around the globe in a few weeks. But where did SARS come from? By constructing an evolutionary tree of the unknown virus as well as viruses taken from other species, we can not only understand which animal gave us SARS, but also reconstruct its path around the globe. This is just one of many problems in modern biology related to constructing evolutionary trees. In 2007, a team of biologists announced that some proteins had miraculously survived within a 68 million year old dinosaur fossil. Moreover, they concluded that the amino acid sequences of these dinosaur proteins were nearly identical to sequences in modern-day chickens. Based on this discovery, famed paleontologist Jack Horner (who inspired the character of Dr. Grant from Jurassic Park) hopes to resurrect dinosaurs by genetically re-engineering a chicken. ﾂ�But did these peptides really come from T. rex? To answer this question, we will need to explore the field of computational proteomics.

Saccharomycesﾂ�yeast is remarkable because it can not only convert the glucose in grapes into ethanol (which we then consume as wine), but it can also invert its own metabolism, consuming the ethanol it just produced in a process called the diauxic shift. ﾂ�To find genes implicated in the diauxic shift, we will learn aboutﾂ�clustering algorithms that will divideﾂ�yeast genes into distinct groups based on their patterns of regulatory behavior.ﾂ�A similar method can be applied to distinguish normal and tumor cells, an approach that led to diagnostic tests like MammaPrint for predicting the return of cancer after chemotherapy. We can also apply clustering algorithms to identify the genetic foundation of human population structure and discover which populations have contributed to your own genome. To do so, we will need to power up clustering algorithms using a powerful computational approach calledﾂ�principal component analysis.

In this chapter, we will learn aboutﾂ�combinatorial pattern matching algorithms for finding these mutations, a task that doctors will eventually be able to carry out within minutes in order to find disease genes. We will then examine the problem of detecting subtle similarities that evade the traditional sequence comparison algorithms that we studied in "Comparing Genes, Genomes, and Proteins".ﾂ�Having efficient algorithms for comparing highly diverged sequences is important, since a single misaligned nucleotide can misclassify a protein and prevent biologists from inferring its function. ﾂ�We will consider a popular approach to sequence comparison based on an abstract machine called a Hidden Markov Model.

What is the logical relationship among data?\n How are the data stored in computers? What algorithms should be operated to solve the problems on the data? These are the questions that will be answered in 窶廛ata Structures and Algorithms窶�, one of the most important core courses in Computer Science.\n The course also covers fundamental data structures and classical algorithms which are widely used in theﾂ�succeeding specialized courses,ﾂ�such as Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Compilerﾂ�Principles, Computer\n Graphics and Human Computer Interaction.\n\n What is the combination of data structures and algorithms? Niklaus Wirth wrote a book titled "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs", which points out their important roles in computing discipline:ﾂ�algorithm and data structure are two closely linked\n and indivisible parts of programming.\n The course will follow the idea ofﾂ� 窶廣lgorithms + Data Structures = Programs窶�, aimed at improvingﾂ� students窶� knowledge and skills of theory, abstraction and design in problem solving.ﾂ�On a solid basis of the fundamental theory, the studentsﾂ�will\n analyze the problems using problem, data and algorithm abstraction. Making a tradeoff between space and time complexity, theﾂ�students will learn how to organize data reasonably, design efficient and effective algorithms, and implement high quality\n programs, so that they can solve real-world complex problems.ﾂ�After studying this course, students should be well prepared for further study, engineering and research in computer related areas.\n The course uses the textbook 窶廛ata Structures and Algorithms窶� written by Prof. Ming Zhang and two otherﾂ� coauthors. The course is appropriate for sophomore students majoring in computer science or other science/engineering disciplines. Students shouldﾂ�have\n learned "introduction to computing",ﾂ�with the knowledge of structured and object-oriented programming.\n\n The course will last for 14 weeks and requires the students to study for 4-8 hours per week.ﾂ�After studying the course, the students窶� ability of abstract thinking and problem solving should have improved considerably.ﾂ�Their programming skills\n and the quality of their codes would have increased as well.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To be qualified for graduation in Peking University, the students need to be familiar about the materials in the textbook, do homework and exam independently, and obtain the score of 60% or moreﾂ�(80% for A score).\n The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy.', 'https://www.coursera.org/course/dsalgo', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V55H4bfmhus', '2013-10-20', 14, 'https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/8a/c3a2d2db02502b1582f3d94bb8e77e/sjjg_608x211_info.jpg', 'ComSci: Theory', 'Coursera', 0, 'Chinese (PRC)', 'yes', 'Peking University', '2015-11-21 09:19:36'),
